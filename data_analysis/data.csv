quick start guidethis guide is to help you begin using uvcharts to build charts on the web  uvcharts uses d3 js and svg html5 to build charts henceforth ie8 and below aren  39 t supported adding the library to your paged3 js being the only dependency for uvcharts  has to be included along with your other scripts before harnessing the power of uvcharts on your webpages  d3 js is available on cdn henceforth you can directly include it using the following code in your webpage download the latest version of uvcharts  either minified or unminified  fromhttp   www github com imaginea uvcharts distand include it too in your webpage using the librarykeeping simplicity as our first priority  we  39 ve ensured that we build a single function api which adheres to all your charting requirements var chartobject   uv chart charttype  graphdefinition  optionalconfiguration  lets get started with a simple example  lets say we want to plot no of users using a certain product for the past 5 years  we need to now represent this data in some form which uvcharts understands graph definitionwhich uvcharts understands is a simple json object with 2 key value pairs       categories          dataset             since we want to just plot data corresponding to one product  say   39 uvcharts  39  itself  the categories array consists of 1 element       categories     39 uvcharts  39        dataset             but we haven  39 t provided the data corresponding to this category yet and that is where the dataset part comes in  lets set some data for uvcharts so we can plot it var graphdef         categories      39 uvcharts  39        dataset               39 uvcharts  39                    name     39 2009  39   value   32                  name     39 2010  39   value   60

uvcharts  lets go ahead and plot this in a dom element using the uvcharts library  all you need to do is call the uv chart function from within the javascript runtime in your page var chart   uv chart   39 bar  39   graphdef  that  39 s it  your chart is ready  the chart is by default placed in a dom element with id   39 uv div  39  and this can be overridden  more on it later  here is the interesting part  no matter which chart you want to represent your data in  the graph definition doesn  39 t change  so if you want to represent the data in the form of a line chart var chart   uv chart   39 line  39   graphdef  more var chart   uv chart   39 area  39   graphdef   var chart   uv chart   39 stackedbar  39   graphdef  the same applies for all 12 chart types that we currently support now you  39 re wondering where do you get to customize the chart in the 100 ways we claim you can  well  the uv chart function takes in a 3rd optional parameter configurationwhich overrides the default configuration thus letting you build your own unique charts if you  39 ve noticed the chart created above  it doesn  39 t have captions and axis labels  thus looks like a dumb representation of some random data  lets go ahead and add them right away var chart   uv chart    39 bar  39   graphdef        meta             caption     39 usage over years  39           subcaption

built in rules which fall into one of three main categories  validation  best practices  and convention each rule is registered via a unique string identifier that can be used to include or exclude it at inspection time here is the full list of built in rules by their identifiers   validation rules validate elements validate element location validate attributes duplicate ids unique elements    best practices inline event handlers script placement unused classes unnecessary elements    convention bem conventionsthe following is a more in depth explanation of each rule validationhtml inspector is different than a markup validator  validators parse static markup  while html inspector runs on a live dom  this makes it a lot more powerful  but there are some drawbacks as well  because html inspector runs after the browser has parsed your html  any mistakes the browser has forgiven will not be seen by html inspector as a result html inspector should not be seen as a replacement for validation  it  39 s simply another tool in the toolbox  that being said  there is still a lot that it can do  and does  to validate your markup here are the validation rules that ship with html inspector   expect this list to get more comprehensive in the future  validate elements  inspect each element in the dom and reports any elements that are invalid or obsolete  this will catch simple things like misspelled tags  instead of ` lt li gt `   and it will inform you of deprecated tags  like  `  and more recently`   any element you don  39 t want to be warned about can be whitelisted validate element location  make sure that elements don  39 t appear as children of parents they  39 re not allowed to descend from  an example of this is a block element likeappearing as the child of an inline elements like `` validate attributes  like validating elements  this rule will let you know if you  39 re using attributes that don  39 t belong on a particular element or perhaps don  39 t belong on any element  if your project uses custom attributes  likeng  in angularjs  they can be whitelisted duplicate ids  warn if non unique ids are found on the same page unique elements  warn if elements that should be unique  likeand  appear more than once in the document best practicessome markup may be perfectly valid but use practices that are commonly considered to be poor or outdated  the following rules check for these types of things   note that everything in this list is subjective and optional  inline event handlers  warn if inline event handlers  likeonclick  quot return false quot are found in the document  inline event handlers are hard to manage  hard to debug  and completely non reusable script placement  warn if script elements appear anywhere other than right before the closingtag  because javascript is blocking  addingelements anywhere other than the end of the document may delay the loading of the page  if a script must appear somewhere other than the end of the document  it can be whitelisted unused classes  sometimes you  39 ll remove a css rule from your stylesheet but forget to remove the class from the html  the  quot unused classes quot  rule compares all the class selectors in the css to the classes in the html and reports any that aren  39 t being used classes that are in the html as javascript hooks can be ignored via a whitelist  by default  any class prefixed withjs  language   orsupports is whitelisted  more information on the rationale behind this rule can be foundhere unnecessary elements  anytime you have a plain amp lt div amp gt or amp lt span amp gt element in the html with no class  id or any other attribute  it  39 s probably unnecessary or a mark of poor design elements with no semantic meaning should only be used for presentation  if the element has no attributes but is used for styling  it must be done through a rule like some class  amp gt  div    which is just asking for trouble  again  more information can be foundhere conventionthe real power of html inspector lies in its ability to enforce your team  39 s chosen conventions  if you  39 ve decided that all groups of links should be contained in a amp lt nav amp gt element  or all amp lt section amp gt elements must contain a heading  you can write those rules  and an error will be thrown when someone breaks them because convention is usually specific to individual teams  there  39 s only one built in rule in this category  but hopefully it  39 ll get you thinking about rules your team could use bem  the increasingly popularbem block  element  modifier  methodology is a css naming convention that is very helpful for large projects  the problem is that using it correctly in the css is only half the battle  if it  39 s not used correctly in the html it doesn  39 t work either this rule throws an error when an element class name is used but that element isn  39 t a descendant of a block by the same name  it also errors when a modifier is used on a block or element without the unmodified class there too  note  there are a few different bem naming conventions out there  html inspector support thethree most common writing your own rulesrules are the bread and butter of html inspector  they are where you check for problems and report errors here  39 s how you add new rules htmlinspector rules add name   config   func name   string  thenameparameter is a string used to identify the rule  it must be unique configoptional object  theconfigparameter stores configuration data that is used by the rule  anything that users of your rule might want to customize themselves should be set in theconfigobject func   function  thefuncparameter is an initialization function that is invoked as soon as you callhtmlinspector inspect    the function is passed three argumentslistener reporter  andconfig  thelistenerobject is used to subscribe to events that are triggered as html inspector is traversing the dom  when problems are found  they can be reported to thereporterobject  theconfigobject is the sameconfigthat was passed tohtmlinspector rules add  though its properties may have been customized by other users between then and now eventsthelistenerobject can subscribe to events via theonmethod  like with many other event binding libraries ontakes two parameters  the event name  and a callback function listener on event  callback event   string  the name of the event  see below for a complete list of events callback   function  a function to be invoked when the event occurs  the function will be passed certain arguments depending on the event type  see the event list below for argument details here is a an example of binding a function to the  quot class quot  event listener on  quot class

"False","restserver","","restserverrestserver is a php library framework for building restful webservices and also websites it allows you to routemethod uriandmime typeto specific resources handlers  access the requested data and provide a proper response here it  39 s decribe its documentation  together with the example folder and tests for reference this version is based on thenamespaces branchofxavier usagethe simplest way is usingcomposer  just declare the restserver dependency in you composer json        quot require quot             quot restserver restserver quot    quot   quot         if not using composer  you can use therestserver phar  just download and require it in your application checkout theapi documentation the serverthe first step to defining you rest service is to instantiate the server  as follows  rest   new rest\serverthis way the server will grab the requested uri to work with  or you can specify a uri if you are not working with urlrewrite for example  if the resource to load is coming from   get  quot q quot    rest   new rest\serve   get   39 q  39    this way restserver will treat   get   39 q  39   as the requested uri creating resourcesthis is the main funcionality of this package  is to define the available resources  rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  url quot   quot action quot   dissecating this  you get a method  a uri and an action  any method is available  even custom ones  uris can be any uri and it support variable parameters  as follow  rest  amp gt addmap  quot post quot   quot  user  id quot   quot action quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  user  id posts quot   quot action quot   will give you a map to the  quot id quot  parameter  more on this later  on action  it can be a rest\controller  a rest\view  a method within any of these or a anonymous function  as such  rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot usercontroller quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot usercontroller  update quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot  function  rest            return  rest         you can also map specific mime types to be accessible  according to the requested  quot accepts quot   rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot action quot  array  quot application json quot      rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot action2 quot  array  quot application xml quot    after setting the resources  you must execute the server echo  rest  amp gt execute   this will trigger the server to work more on resources handling on future topics global utilitiesthe server have a few utilities to deal with the global server scope you can set variables to be acessible at any rest resource as follow  rest  amp gt setparameter  quot key quot   value    key    rest  amp gt getparamter  quot key quot   you can also get all setted parameters with  params    rest  amp gt getparameters   you can set global accepted mime types  rest  amp gt setaccept array  quot application json quot   quot text html quot    you can dinamically set get the requested uri  rest  amp gt setquery  quot  uri quot     rest  amp gt getquery     rest  amp gt getbaseurl   the usage is very simple  first you  39 ll need to include either the  quot phar quot  or the initial rest server php class  lt  php include   39 restserver phar  39   api   new rest\server       more logic to come here   api  gt execute      amp gt you can instantiate the rest\server to start handling the requests  it will get the uri from the http request  but you can also provide a custom one for the rest\server  url  constructor after configuring the server you call the  quot execute quot  method so it can chain the request response cicle mappingmost of work is mapping uris to functions or controllers you can map any method  even custom  and uri to a lambda closure function or to a controller class  that implements rest\controller  or a specific method of a controller  lt  php  api  gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  some resource quot  function  api           api  amp gt addmap  quot post quot   quot  some

quot  foo   bar quot   quot mycontroller  mymethod quot  array  quot text html quot       amp gt the uri parameter accepts any regex  and also name parameters   name or   name for optional parameter   and an array of accepted mime types controllers and views also apply to lambda closure all controllers to be mapped must implement rest\controller  it implies in implementing a single default method as follow and a public constructor with no arguments or optional arguments   lt  php class mycontroller implements rest\controller           public function execute  rest                      gt other method that might get mapped into the server must also receive this one parameter this method parameter is an instance of the rest\server from where you can get the request details  data and response the methods can return the rest server  to end the cycle  or another controller or view to follow the request to  lt  php class mycontroller implements rest\controller           public function execute  rest                return new myvieworothercontroller  anydataornot     will foward the request                   gt the same apply to views  but implements rest\view default controllers and

above 0 indicates a problem  exit code   the signal tells how the process ended  i e  can be a sigterm you killed it withstream kill    if it  39 s null  then it ended normally and of course  you can
