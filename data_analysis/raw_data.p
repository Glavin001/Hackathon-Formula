aVyou know how in video games like diablo 2  and starcraft    you have a little minimap in the corner that shows you where you  39 ve been  and leaves a fog of war in the locations that you have yet to visit  well  i think that those maps are cool with our android app  minimap  you can find out where you  39 ve been  and you may even feel compelled to visit new places in the dark unknown of the minimap we have also constructed a pebble app so that the user can view the map and determine what direction to go to travel into uncharted territory directly from the wrist

aVneuro 1 was the concept of co creator christopher jones who had suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2007 to his frontal lobe and has been searching for ways to improve his brain function since  he discovered the concept in a wired magazine article about a community of people who strap sponges soaked in saline to their head and administer current to their brains to augment their brain function  chris saw opportunity here and ways to improve upon the design  micro controllers could be used to regulate the current and the electrodes could be more focused and targeted than a diffuse sponge strapped to the side of his head  he dreamed up a prototype and suggested it to his friend brian lutz while walking across the campus at the university of pennsylvania for penn apps  brian talked chris into perusing this hack  after all here he would have access to some of the best engineering resources in the world  they also teamed up with bill hoag who had never heard of anything like this  but was enthusiastic to be part of it we began researching this project and spent the first day investigating methods of current delivery  montages of the skull for electrode placement  clinical research to verify any claims  and so on  we then designed an apparatus to be laser cut on medium density fiber board using living hinges to achieve pliability  in the rapid prototyping lab dorron  courtney  and elizabeth were invaluably helpful in constructing this prototype and direction to resources around campus  from there we sought  the help of the mentors at intel to figure out a wiring schematic  none of us had electronic experience but we were able to construct a digital analog converter out of an arduino and deliver a measured amount of current to specific electrodes on our apparatus in our research we found that delivering low level current to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex would acheive a number of very desirable outcomes  so we decided to focus on that region of the brain  the dlpfc is sort of a hub for executive functioning in the brain  it controls things like working memory  cognitive flexibility  planning  inhibition  and abstract reasoning  we also found that a number of conditions such as schizophrenia  depression  substance abuse  and alchoholism demonstrate decreased levels of activity in this region of the brain neur 1 can be used to increase brain activity in this region of the brain  the result of this could be world changing  low level voltage could be used in the treatment of neurological or mental health disorders  it can be used to increase the brain  39 s ability to encode new information by strengthening neural pathways and thus physically altering the structure of the brain making it more conducive to performing particular thought patterns  this could be extremely helpful for students cramming for exams or anyone who would appreciate a boost in cognitive performance  a further application for this technology is the modulation of pain related neural networks by acting on the primary motor cortex neur 1 is tesla  39 s wet dream  using electrical current we could potentially free ourselves from our dependency on pharmaceuticals by reinforcing the brain  39 s ability to function  the long term ramifications for this technology are limitless and we  39 ve only just begun to scratch the surface

aVsuzanne  39 s passion for climbing inspired the idea of using technology to relay commands between the climber and belayer when they are out of sight and hearing range   the result is a proof of concept to see how the intel edison can be used for device to device communication   both the compact size and computing power are suitable for the exploration of wearables that have multiple functions and complex communication between them the target user would be climbers that need a complete suite of features that makes their trek more safe and fun for everyone  high in the mountains communication can be difficult  and both weather conditions as well as distance  body position and acoustics can affect the communication of the group  with an intelligent wearable we aim to provide climbers with wireless conectivity between the group members so communication among the group can be fast and efficient  the product could also be potentially used to gather data from the trip as well as take pictures and video for fun the key features we are most proud of are  use of wireless communication to send messages that use both vibration and light to capture the climber  39 s attention and to transmit simple and fast messages  use of flex sensors to control a servomotor that allows the user to move their camera  e g  gopro  to take awesome pictures and or photos while they have their arms busy climbing  we used the intel edison for this task  which is a very new and exciting board  it is a very powerfu and interesting board l and it was personally a very interesting challenge

aVi  39 m developing a new commercial game engine called blurrr  based on sdl    cross platform  steamos linux  mac  windows  ios  android    write in c c    lua  or javascript  or any language that can talk to c    open architecture   bring the toolchain of the aaa industry to the mainstreami have been behind the scenes developing other commercial game engines in the past  and the common problem that emerged was professional game developers hit a wall with the tools and can  39 t work around them  the out of the box experience makes cool demos  but game developers that need to solve real problems often become blocked because the sdks make it hard or impossible to do the non trivial case blurrr goes back to the basics and is designed with the idea to provide the common things devs need  but also get out of the way when it doesn  39 t and let developers get access to everything they need to get the job done  real game development is about getting stuff done  even with ugly hacks  and blurrr is a recognition of that flappy bird is a great example because even though it is a simple game  it has a lot of artistic decisions that are often overlooked which contradict out of the box experiences for most sdks for example  flappy bird uses real physics for gravity  but the way the bird collides and flaps contradicts real physics all the flappy bird clones and tutorials are actually quite disappointing in my opinion because they fail to acknowledge the subtle detail work in flappy bird  often they use a physics engine  but fail to take into account the odd behaviors  probably because it is too hard to work around in those engines additionally  many clones didn  39 t perform well  flappy bird runs at 60fps   and only run on one or two platforms so flappy blurrr is a faithful recreation of flappy bird  which celebrates all the subtle detail work in flappy bird by trying to bring attention to it  i believe i have succeeded in channeling the spirit of flappy bird better than any other clone tutorial out there  and this is intended to show developers how to deal with those hard edge cases and show it can be done this will eventually be made into a tutorial for blurrr sdl and game programming in general with source code available supports  mac  10 6   64 bit  windows  requires windows 7 or greater  64 bit intel  steamos linux  64 bit amd64  android  arm  armv7  x86  ios  universal

aVhi  we  39 re here to introduce you to hermione  the only live updating forum built specifically for public qanda it  39 s no secret that computer science lectures are getting huge  after all  more and more people are learning to code  but all this growth leads to a problem  often  classes are so packed with inquisitive students that a professor is frequently forced to stop lecture and answer people  39 s questions  of course answering questions is a good thing  because it benefits everyone  not just the person who asked  but sometimes questions are redundant  or even worse  completely off topic it was while sitting in such a lecture that i had the idea for hermione   quot there  must be some way to ask the same questions  but without all the redundancy and off topic ness  quot  and sure enough  there is  the product we have developed is a simple solution to this problem that allows everyone to get their say  while favoring the most urgent questions  everyone simply logs on to hermione  and posts their questions  while up voting other relevant ones  the speaker can periodically check which questions are trending and answer them  after a question gets answered  it  39 s tucked away but not forgotten  just in case someone needs it later   it has many advantages over  traditional qanda  it  39 s anonymous  it  39 s fast  it  39 s easy  it  39 s interactive  it  39 s unobtrusive  it has emma watson  39 s face on it in the future  we  39 d love to expand this project by adding comments  expiring pages  support for side by side streaming  questions embedded content  and much more we haven  39 t thought of yet the sky  39 s the limit  so raise your hand

aVwe have made revolutionary hack where people can do tasks by just moving their hand in the air  we hope that people who like virtual stuff can use this in their everyday life to set reminders  store data such or anything they can manage to just wave their finger in writing motion in the air and it will automatically parse the task trying to be achieved  using ocr we convert those gestures into letters eventually combining them based on the users input we are proud of using accelerometer to achieve this even though that was the hardest part of this hack  accelerometer only give acceleration  but to find the velocity and the position we had to do double integration  but even after doing that the raw data and the noise in the data would give a lot of inaccurate information  so to minimise the noise and errors a filter was applied that would make the graph of the data much smoother  we used another library that had built in character recognition making the converting gestures into words a lot easier

aVat the beginning of each semester like many other penn students  i spend hours trying to fit all my classes into a working schedule  the idea for penn course ninja came to me earlier this semester when i was struggling to find a way to combine my comp sci classes and general interest classes in a neat schedule  with time i hope that i can make penn course ninja better and eventually public so it can help other penn students  my favorite feature is the  quot generate schedule quot  button  if students are unhappy with the times of the classes scheduled  they can simply press the  quot generate schedule quot  button again and a new schedule with different times will appear

aVdoubletake is a compatibility analyzer that uses breakthrough research  http   goo gl 4tb36i  to find your personality doppelganger  it uses linguistic analysis and your facebook data to find out which of your friends you connect with best  the analysis finds that similarities in speech and writing style often correlate to closer and better relationships we were inspired by the success of fivelabs  a personality predictor that went viral during the summer of 2014  while fivelabs simply provided a personality profile of you and your friends  we saw an opportunity to conduct a more direct linguistic analysis  we wanted to provide our users with both a useful and entertaining way to visualize their relationships our target user is anyone who wants to find out more about themselves and their friends  this app will make you look twice at your friends  because you may never see them the same way again due to facebook  39 s long review process regarding permissions  only administrators of doubletake can demonstrate the app during this hackathon

aVmost of the times  the applications which track a lost phone need wifi  so we thought of a wi fi free solution which uses the good old long forgotten bluetooth when a user loses his phone  he then immediately sends a text message containing a code which would be setup when the user first uns the application  to his phone  the application starts running and sees if it has received a valid code from the owner  if so  it immediately turns on the bluetooth and sends a message via bluetooth to the all the nearby bluetooth peers asking them to inform the owner of its location and the present timestamp it doesn  39 t have any interface but we are showing one  just to portray what gets displayed

aVpostcard is an interactive email ecosystem  from creation to completion  an email flows through various states as you work when you receive an email  that event will cause a card to be created and automatically placed in the  quot to do quot  group of your workflow  this makes it explicitly clear that some action must be taken on this new email  and will prevent you from reading the email once and forgetting about it until a few weeks later this inspiration for this application came from frustrations using standard email tools and the lack  of ability to manage workload generated from email effectively our favorite features  sync cards with gmail using google  39 s api reactjs draggable objects implemented from scratch

aVcollisionsensesmart traffic collision avoidance system using bluetooth low energy beacons  gt  collisionsense is an elegant solution to today  39 s problems involving accidents that occur at intersections in the city  given the scale of the issue we wanted to come up with a solution does not require any setup or initial investment  we wanted to deploy a system that could leverage existing hardware and software and can start operating from the get go tech gt  the technologies primarily leveraged by our app are bluetooth low energy  ibeacons  and gps  the reason for having such a simplified stack is motivated by our goal to maximize the user base for this system  so a large number of people can benefit from it  and the fact the we wanted to avoid any hard setup  or initial investment working gt  the system works by creating a cluster of beacons at an intersection  this mesh is used by each individual device to position itself relative to other vehicles and pedestrians  using this information we are able to warn users when another entity approaches a dangerously close distance  we can track and monitor multiple vehicles pedestrians at a time and keep the user informed about the current scenario around them the app starts with a screen checking access to thepermissionsrequired by the app  it also requiresbluetooth to be on at all times once you tapcontinue  you  39 re taken to theintegrated main screenof the app there are4parts to this user interface on thetop  you have themap  updating real time with your location and heading right below that  you have what we call ourbeacon radar this is theheartof our application as it providesreal time information regarding all the vehicles and pedestrians that are in your vicinity upontapping the radar we show you the classification of users that are around you based on their mode of transport  cycling  walking or driving   the icon in the center automatically shows your current mode of transport  by tapping into your iphone  39 s motion processor finally  at the bottom of the screen we show you yourspeed of travel and a statement describing the current scenario around the intersection how it worksthe map viewthe map obtained is provided by google maps the map continuously tracks the location of the user along with heading and distance the map also shows real time traffic data provided by google beacon radarthe beacon radar contains an icon representing the user in his her current mode of transportation in the center and concentric circles around this icon the largest circle shows the number of beacons that are at a significant distance from the user  these could be cyclists  pedestrians or car drivers the inner circle shows the beacons that are currently near the user  this would show cars that might have halted right next to the user  39 s car the innermost circle is reserved for emergency situations where a car cyclist pedestrian is dangerously close to the user  when this happens the inner circle starts to pulsate rapidly and a voice warning is initiated to grab the user  39 s attention the beacons  39  distances from the user are figured out by a complex algorithm involving the measuring of the strength of the signal from every beacon the user  39 s phone is performing 2 roles  it broadcasts itself as a beacon and scans for beacons around the user  it performs both of these tasks in quick succession so as to provide the users with the most up to date status of the intersection each beacon broadcast differently based on the mode of transport in use by that particular user  hence our app is able to classify all the signals reaching it and show the user a consolidated view of users of the different modes of transport in his her vicinity  this data can be viewed by tapping on the radar view  and can be dismissed by tapping again speed and scenariothis is the bottom most section of the display  it shows the real time speed of the user obtained via gps it also briefly describes the current situation in the intersection in an easily glance able sentence it is important to note that collisionsense seamlessly switches from one intersection to another as the user travels as our app is continuously monitoring for beacons and hence possible collisions the app does not transmit any user specific data from device to device  all data transmitted is a generic and only relates to the app  no user can be uniquely identified by the data transmitted future improvementsthis whole can be easily ported to android  as android has full support for ble  as of android 4 3  and full third part support for ios beacons

aVtechnology distractions are negatively impacting pedestrian safety  pedestrians are spending increasingly more time on their smartphones  studies have shown that 26  pedestrians text or email  51  talk on the phone and 36  listen to music while crossing the street in cities like new york and san francisco  municipalities have started painting  quot look  quot  signs at crosswalks in an attempt to alert pedestrians who text and walk  we believe that a technology solution would be more effective for the problem at hand  an important role of the smartphone is to enhance our safety by steering our attention back to the real world  our application generates targeted electronic alerts when the pedestrian is entering the street  and urges the pedestrian to look up  existing technology approaches use the camera on the smartphone for pedestrian safety  this approach needs direct line of sight to the approaching vehicle  which is not possible if the pedestrian is walking and texting  we propose two approaches that  detect when a pedestrian is crossing the street  the smartphone only approach uses the gps available on the smartphone to predict the pedestrian  39 s path of motion  it alerts the distracted pedestrian if the predicted path intersects with a street  indicating that the pedestrian is about to enter the street  it works whether you cross the street at an intersection or a midblock location  our second approach is that of wearable sensing  we use shoe mounted sensors for creating ground profiles and identifying road features that separate street and sidewalk  such as ramps and curbs  when a pedestrian transitions from sidewalk to street via ramps and curbs  he is alerted to look up and be careful  the application runs in the background and does not affect the user  39 s interaction with the phone  a warning look up sign overlays on the user  39 s active screen  with this application  we hope to enhance pedestrian safety without altering their way of life

aVmy friends and i are visiting san francisco and bikes are our primary transportation choice  the problem is that we were caught unprepared when the temperature went down after a very sunny day  our solution was to create an app where you set you destination and how long you are going to stay there and then ask   39 should i use my bike   39   we are going to give you an graphical answer based on forecast for that period of time  you can also set alerts  so you don  39 t need to ask that everyday before going to work  you just need to say where and when you are going to work and we are going to send you an sms everyday advising if you should or not ride your bike

aVour idea when writing queri me was to make an extensible remote control system that is easily accessible via any phone  we are trying not only to target sysadmins  but also the average user  we wanted to build something which we would find useful in our day to day lives  the agent  which the queri me server queries  is written in python and is thus cross platform  all a user has to do is run the agent on a machine they want to monitor  and they can get statistics and certain files they allow remotely  the agent is availablehere  users can interface with queri me via either sms or phone  we use the twilio api for both  and process the sms voice with wit ai  we currently have three operations  statistics  reminders  and files making requestsmaking a request is very simple  first  follow the instructions to register and confirm a phone with queri me  then  either send a text message to  or call   517  219 4225  with your query  more information on queries is below aliasesbecause queri me can only query valid ips or domain names  we created aliases  aliases allow for the substitution of common words in place of ips or domain names when users make requests for information  for example  if my server is metrictwist firebase io  i can alias twist to metrictwist firebase io then make requests about twist statisticsusers can query  processes  user count  load average  temperature  memory usage  and bits of entropy available  they can also request an overview  which will return all of this at once syntaxnote  because queri me uses natural language  most requests which include the statistic to request and the server alias to request it for will work  below are some examples  hey  what  39 s the temperature on laptop  what is the load average on swift how many users on server  overview of server  please  give me an overview for laptop what is the average on web overview web memory used webremindersusers can set sms reminders in intervals of 10 minutes for any task syntax set a reminder for me in 10 minutes to reboot my server remind me tomorrow to upgrade sshd can you remind me in 30 minutes to download the new library find filesusers can find files in certain directories that they have defined before  for example  they could define a  quot shared quot  directory that is accessible through queri me  they can then use queri me to search for keywords  and read the file remotely syntax find my english essay on laptop where is my biology paper on laptop easter eggszero and the konami code

aVthis app is intended to instruct new and slightly experienced drivers who drive a manual transmission and guide them through their first experiences with the car  the app receives real time data from the vehicle utilizing openxcs platform which contains a obdii port  the obdii port transmits the data to the app via bluetooth for processing  our app then is able to run through defined states to instruct the user exactly how to drive a stick  if the user prefers more than just visualization on the app  they can turn on text to speech where they can have the instructions read to them  furthermore  the app is connected to google maps and can use a navigational route with the shifting algorithms to allow users to optimize their shifting patterns on their way to work or on a road trip  we look forward to adding new features to the app and the apps have provisions for tons of additional features  firebase allows us to manage user profiles and facebook allows us to share our results to the personal network

aVi study electrical engineering at georgia tech  i do web development as a hobby during the weekends  as a web developer  i am often forced to use captcha systems to prevent bots from posting spam and creating fake accounts  even though captcha systems help in combating spam  they often have a detrimental effect on the user interface  captcha images are sometimes very difficult to interpret and users will have to take multiple attempts to solve the captcha image i wanted to see if it was possible to eliminate the need for people to fill out captchas to prove that they are human  that  39 s how this project came about  verifica does behavioral analysis of the person machine filling out the form  in order for a human to fill out a form  he she has to  physically press keys on his her keyboard and use the mouse to navigate around the form  but a bot doesn  39 t have a keyboard or a mouse  it is just inserting pre defined values into form fields and is trying to submit the form as fast as it can  verifica collects data about the above mentioned parameters and using the data collected  its algorithm determines whether the form filler is a human or a machine my target audience for this project is developers who are building awesome projects  they can use verifica to eliminate spam without causing inconvenience for real human users  the key feature that i am really proud about verifica is its simplicity  the concept behind verifica is very easy to understand even for non developers

aVinspiration  one evening during the holidays last year my wife commented that i spend too much time on facebook  like an instant reflex  i denied the claim  but then i thought that i really had no data and could see why she might be right  i didn  39 t actually know how much time i spent actually working  vs playing games vs social media or online video  and this is a common problem  today four of us got together to get visibility into our online life by building fitline  a tool to monitor and hopefully control how a person spends his or her time on phones and computers target user  fitline is for any person who believes that a healthy life needs a balance between how much time we spend in the digital world vs the real world  such a person would like to monitor their time spent on phone and computer  and have tools to make manage and control that time key features  fitline does app and site level tracking using browser plugins and a mobile app  it then analyzes the data to get a detailed analysis of how a person is spending time on phone computer  not all time spent on these devices is equal  some is for work and necessary but maybe the time on social or video or games needs to be reduced  maybe work needs to take a backseat in certain times of day  with fitline  39 s comprehensive tracking a user can see the full details and make informed choices  monitor how they are performing against their goals and get help from fitline in attaining their goals

aVthese days between 40 and 50 percent of couples in the usa will get divorced  what if there was an algorithm that could predict with 85  accuracy whether a couple would stay together or get divorced  think of all the pain and suffering this would alleviate this might sound crazy  but by using 40 years of research from the worlds foremost relationship researcher  dr  john gottman  our team has married dr  gottman  39 s techniques and methodologies with a facial recognition algorithm that can observe a couple and give them feedback as to how their relationship is doing overall our app works by recording the facial expressions of couples as they talk about an area of conflict in their relationship  and then processing this facial data with a facial coding system know as spaff  using these methods we can create an overall score for the relationship and for each partner our goal is to reduce the divorce rate in the united states by 1  over the next two years  we aim to achieve this by helping couples understand how their relationships are doing and by providing them with the proven resources necessary to strengthen and repair their relationships

aVat the start of the hackathon  i was thinking a bit about what it would look like if one extended the game of checkers into three dimensions  a couple of days and one 624 line c   file of uncharacteristically underengineered code  i think i have a definitive answer to that question the interface to my submission is fairly simplistic  the display consists of a three dimensional network of red  blue  and gray nodes and a red and blue bar at the top to indicate both player  39 s progress towards domination of the network  blue goes first  and will see all of the nodes that they can advance flashing alternately with the node that they currently have selected  which flashes slightly brighter   they will then pick the node that they want to move using either the keyboard  wasdqe  or by clicking it with the mouse  they can also use the mouse to rotate the network for a better view   and  after hitting enter  they can select which of the spaces that the node can currently move into using the same methods  opposing nodes can be jumped by  quot moving towards quot  them the same way that one would move onto the unoccupied gray nodes  and multiple jumping is supported  when a colored node reaches the home plane of the other player  it will double in size and be able to move in all 12 directions  instead of just the forward 4 that it could before   as in traditional checkers

aVbehind the scenethe idea originated when we were thinking of what could be a burning need for us if we were to run a small to medium sized business  as a shop owner with an elegant looking clover station loaded with cool applications  i would love to have an app which could tell me approximately how many items i would be selling and what the potential traffic in my store could be analysiswe started with the historical transaction data that was available for a merchant in the clover database  as we were crunching the numbers we soon realized that both the leaderboard of predicted sales as well as   quot busyness index quot   we coined this term as it pretty much indicates how busy a store is going to be  were based on quite a lot of variables  we started to write down an exhaustive list of variables such as   quot weather quot    quot impact on promotions quot    quot impact on holidays quot    quot impact of events happening in neighborhood quot  etc   for want of time  we decided to just pursue with including the weather variable in our fully working mvp solution mvp versionwhat we have done in a nutshell is marry the historical weather data simulated  available for the locality of a particular business with the historical transaction data  the question we asked ourselves as we were developing the algorithm was  quot if tomorrow is going to be rainy compared to a sunny today   will the coffee sales in my store go up compared to an average day  because a lot more people might want something hot to drink on a cold morning  quot  i think we got an extremely convincing answer when we crunched the numbers our pridethe feature that we are really proud of we love all the features    is definitely the  leaderboard of items  that i would potentially be selling during my peak hours  we feel that with more data and more variables the precision would only get better and thereby helping a store owner reduce wastage and also manage store staffing in a smart way

aVbluemix was a large inspiration for this project   we had not heard of it before mhacks 2014  and we immediately knew we wanted to work with it   we were previously familiar with twitter api and brainstormed how we could use bluemix  39 s technology to come up with something great we have always had a strong interest in obtaining information to  run more optimized procedures with topics such as marketing campaigns   we felt as if it could be very useful to brands to know who their most loyal customers are  and possibly reward them   that is where our idea came into play our project uses twitter api to record how often customers tweet about and engage with their favorite brands   this information can be used by the brands for many services  such as continuing campaigns that show a high engagement yield to even choosing to reward their top loyal customers and advocates on social media   this information was then moved to mongodb where it was stored and later uses the sendgrid api to conveniently deliver the newly gained information to the inboxes of those who used our services

aVyou need to type in your password to access almost any sensitive aspect of your life  whether you want to see your emails  social media accounts  or academic portals  the login page is the gate keeper for all of them this makes our passwords all the more important to safeguard because with it anyone can gain access to any of our accounts  thus  what we propose is to use our webcam  which most devices  laptops and smartphones  have  to track the movement of our eyes  this allows us to trace out patterns with our eyes that we can map to the various passwords we have for our different accounts for different services  by combining the webcam  39 s images with opencv  we can decode the pattern and check if it maps to a password which we can then insert into the password input box of the form for the user  in the case that the pattern is incorrect we can insert an arbitrary password into the password field we have developed this hack for web browsers first  but strongly believe that the same technologies could be extended to be used on mobile devices as well  this way the user will have the same exact user experience when logging into a service on the phones and on the laptops  we strongly believe that this product will help bridge the ease of use disparity between laptops  where it  39 s easy to type  and mobile devices  where it is a little bit harder  as for the group of users we target  it is everyone who could potentially read this  meaning anyone with an electronic device with internet access   our product  traze  can make it easier for anyone and everyone to login in to anything the coolest part of the project in our opinion is how we use opencv to decode the pattern created by our eyes  the eyes cover so little real estate on the screen that is makes it not only a hard thing to track  but also a more secure method for protecting our passwords but is trace really that cool  you decide

aVwhat can i eat?!
p2953
aS''
aVi thought of this idea a couple of weeks ago when i was looking up an online pdf to see what i can eat at  quot arby  39 s quot   because i have a sever dairy and fish allergy   sometimes the ingredients are hard to find  and once you are able to find the pdf file you have to read through it to know what you can or cannot eat that is why we created this web application   to help people with food allergies find what they can eat at major chain restaurants quickly with the touch of a few buttons in this application users are asked two things  what allergies do they have  and what major chain restaurant they want to eat at  they can then press  quot what can i eat   quot  and then they are brought to results page that displays all of the food items they are able to eat at that given chain restaurant some of the key features we use in this website is an advanced search  which allows people to specify their food allergy more specifically  for example  i myself cannot eat  quot caseinate quot  which is milk derivative  but i am able to consume lactose and whey  both of which are milk proteins   if i selected  quot dairy quot  in the general search  the website would tell me i cannot have certain items because of lactose or whey  even though i would actually be able to consume them this advanced search is very exhaustive and covers all of the major 8 food allergies  we soon aim to implement support for vegetarian and vegan users as well where we are looking to head after mhacks is to expand this website to accommodate more major chain restaurants  add some more optimization on the back end of the website  and then possibly construct an api for food ingredients at chain restaurants the thought  and its still in its very early stages  about constructing an api was that our group looked for an api that contained the actual ingredients in the food items at major chain restaurants  but we couldn  39 t find any  without the actual ingredient lists  an  quot advanced search quot  would not be able to be implemented and that is a huge part of what makes our website appealing to those with allergies  another quick example is that if someone was allergic to walnuts and not almonds but we didn  39 t have specific ingredient lists for the food items  it would have an allergen alert for  quot tree nuts quot  but the user wouldn  39 t know whether he could eat it or not because it is too vague  below are some screenshots of our websites  39  ui   it is definitely in its alpha release so some styles will be changed  major update   a representative from mashery came and talked to us about their api  39 s and introduced us to the  quot foodessentials quot  api so now there is a lot of room for growth to expand this idea to supermarkets and other food items outside of the chain restaurants idea

aVwhen we came up with telegraphic  we wanted an app that is fun  easily accessible  and a new way to connect to other people telegraphic is a collaborative app that we built from the ground up  it  39 s a native android and ios app that allows one friend to start a drawing and then lets other friends continue to work on the same picture from their phone  however  each time a friend is allowed to edit an image  he or she is only able to edit it for 10 seconds  after that  it will get sent to the next person they choose  when the image has been sent to 5 different people to be worked on  all friends involved in the process get the final result of the picture there were some technical hurdles we had to overcome to accomplish this hack  for example  we only have the ability to draw in black  red  green  and blue because people are only able to edit the image for 10 seconds and needed quick buttons as they frantically finish their part of the art  we also wanted a quick way for one to edit their brush size so we implemented a pinching as way for one to quickly modify the stroke of their brush everything we made was built from the ground up  the backend was developed using python  the bottle framework  and sqlite  then  both the ios app and android app were developed natively and built around our backend we kind of imagined telegraphic as a telephone game for friends  although one person may have an idea for a picture  the next may have a completely different vision and make the picture to their liking  we consider this app to be half social experiment half game  we want to see what people think about their friends are thinking when they draw the craziest stuff each little picture is a masterpiece in their own way  each little piece has its own story  when one uses telegraphic  they  39 re not only having fun with their friends  they  39 re making art that they can appreciate you can view our github pages regarding the app here backendiosandroid

aVwe felt as though simplifying tasks at home could be a good way to save time and less stress on managing electricity use at or inside a home  we had issues with controlling all of the outlets around the room that we lived in so we wanted to figure out a way to control it through a program  implementing something simple such as turning on and off power sockets could be an easy way to lower the concerns and worry regarding energy use and suited for a busy schedule  we wanted to learn how to how to replicate the rf signal from the remote that originally powered power sockets i was able to get help using an oscilloscope through an experienced ee via googlehangout  he showed us how to find the frequency emitted from the remote  we figured out a way to remotely control power sockets with a 433mhz rf transmitter attached to an arduino as computer science majors we proud to be able enough to get the program to control switches on and off

aVit all started with i clickers  normally  a student would only require one of these for a small number of classes in his or her college lifetime  which could be as little as one  it was a hassle to purchase one and because of its size  the i clicker can be easily misplaced  frustrated    39 voteapp  39  was built as a web application that behaves exactly like an i clicker  our app has three main features conduct polls in real time users will be able to run polls real time through unique urls with the option of tracking the number of votes  the number of voters  the poll results and the time period of a session  poll creators also determine poll choices and our app  39 s graph would show responses instantly  on the flipside  voters can join a polling session with a click of a button and begin choosing an option vote on any device since voteapp is a web application  any device with internet access would be able to use the app right away  our ui design is mobile friendly and can work on any platform   future plans include integrating twilio api so that cell phones can send text messages to vote on a poll set up by our app accessible to everyone voteapp aims to make polling easy and accessible to everyone  because of the simple interface and ubiquity  voteapp is the perfect app for short term polling and democratic voting  we plan to make it free for everyone as part of the open source initiative we aim our app to be used by college professors and students during class  by bosses and employees during meetings  and by celebrities and fans during popularity contests  ultimately  we want voteapp to be the future of voting  our future ideas include adding a twilio api  an option for public and private pollings  and also user authentication check us out during the expo today and try voteapp right away

aVit started when the four of us were talking about chrysler  39 s new challenger out by the dow building  and how it was a manual   but two of us didn  39 t know how to drive a manual transmission  meanwhile  the other two know well   after people had taken time to teach them  something that  39 s precious and not always available realizing this  we decided to try and create a manual transmission driving instructor  that could be displayed on a chrysler vehicle  39 s radio head unit  reading information from the car  39 s sensors using the openxc platform tools that chrysler had brought along  this would also be handy for me at home  because i spend a lot of time teaching my friends how to drive stick   and i would like to teach more   but it  39 s hard to find the time  it  39 s an excellent job to automate the integration of car sensors using an open source platform like openxc  connected to the internet  with powerful visual and auditory feedback   this are the ingredients for serious potential for education and learning   from manual transmissions to online classes

aVas high school students  my friends and i were often tormented by chemistry  it made no sense the first time around  and took a long time to learn it  as we grew  we eventually learned to enjoy chemistry  however we found that as children  it was significantly hard to learn the subject from just watching the teacher and reading the books  we wanted an easy and fun way to learn chemistry and decided to share our knowledge of chemistry through an outlet we thought was appropriate  games  we made a game where users will be given a select set of elements to combine and create molecules  each level has a theme and a given set of molecules to create  players will have to combine and create the molecules as fast as possible  we spent countless hours creating atoms and molecules from scratch for the game  and many hours discussing how we could reach our goal with the project  a game that will reach the classrooms of typical middle and high schools one feature of our game we were most proud of was the easy to use user interface to select elements  we used a scroll view controller in order to allow the user to scroll through 14 elements  crowding the screen with 14 elements was definitely not an option  so a scroll view was definitely the most optimal way to go about our game the other feature of our game that we were proud of is the accuracy of the 14 elements and over 30 molecules that we created from scratch  we made sure to choose molecules that taught the basics of atomic chemistry  our level system is themed  with each level teaching the user about special groups of molecules  an ionic bond level  acid and bases  even common household goods  such as dry ice and gasoline  we challenged our users to create molecules in order to experience different areas of atomic chemistry although our game is only in a prototype stage  we plan on taking the game to the fullest extent  adding more levels and improving the user interface even after the hackathon  next time you browse the app store  look our for molecule mash  an easy and explosively fun way to learn atomic chemistry

aVwhile most any hacker will tell you that they are looking to the future with their big ideas  many hacks simply don  39 t come to fruition at hackathon competitions or fall to the wayside only weeks after the excitement has died down  why  what is the main factor leading to this  over the past hackathons i have attended as a volunteer and graphic designer and have been inspired by seeing new hackers rise rapidly to the top while extremely talented students flounder and fail to achieve a finished product for my rather unorthodox   39 hack  39  i decided to begin a larger project of getting into the minds and actions of fellow attendees to figure out what group dynamics make groups work or what causes them to fail  my hackathon began with delving into articles of group psychology  then spending time spent mingling with and recording current hackers in a casual video https   www youtube com watch v 5lnipqwllhwafter speaking with many experienced hackers about my the untapped potential of helping to form more successful groups  i spent the rest of my time preparing a unique survey to measure group dynamics  perception of the group  and focus of the vision  this is a beta survey which will be revised over the next semester and will be rereleased at the next mhacks hackathon  this project will culminate in my senior honors thesis https   umich qualtrics com se  sid sv 6fqukrmlo53ugqp

p3698
aS''
aVto start off  i have to explain the situation  project contingency is being developed  in the beautiful cryengine  by my team and i  when i got to hack isu  i saw they had an oculus rift  so i decided to implement oculus rift into our game  oculus rift just being the hype that it is inspired me to implement it into project contingency  i started with the oculus sdk and tried to implement that  it was past my knowledge  so i started looking for pre existing implementations  after digging through the cryengine source code  i found out that it was already implemented  but required some tweaks to get it working  i had to activate it in cryengine  change the settings in the oculus rift and extend the screens  i found all that out on my own by just running through source code  then i had to take all of my preexisting data and reformat it to meet the resolution requirements of the oculus rift  after everything was edited  resized  and coded back in  i staged it all out to look good on the rift  i am currently prepping it for the presentation   d one of the coolest things i implemented was the changed loading screen  custom for the oculus rift   i tried to make it 3d ish by getting really close to the users eyes because project contingency was in development before i implemented this  i dont know if that disqualifies me  if it does  i could see why but i still had fun developing it and will probably use this in the real release of the game ps   i cant upload 14 gigs of data    so i hope you liked the video   p

aVthe initial idea of the app came up to us when we saw this video https   www youtube com watch v zxyy ep5nh0we decided that if the person is shown the back of the screen while walking they will see any obstacles on their way and it will prevent such situations it took us about a week to come up with the first version of the app and it went viral just after it was launched on reddit  ever since we have improved the app a lot  the latest android version 3 0 posted a few days ago includes an all new universal transparent mode which turns the camera view behind any launched app or the android launcher and makes our app usable not only for texting  but also for using navigation and google maps while walking or cycling so far it has generated tens of thousands of paid downloads  on both ios and android and we also had a free version which we discontinued which was downloaded another 500 000 times as seen in the queen latifah show posted a couple of moths ago the app is still popular due to its high fun and safety factor http   youtu be mvo5gw7aele t 1m8sthe app is available on android  ios  blackberry playbooks and bada devices here is a promo video of the ios versionhttps   www youtube com watch v oglnzw0vrbw

aVi  39 ve been a fan of videogames for a long time   so when i was deciding on what to do  i thought of skyrim  minecraft  and many other games   i hoped i could incorporate a little of the flavor of those games  my target user is anyone who wants to spend a few mintes playing a simple game   i am most proud of the controls   the player can use the traditional arrow navigation keys to move around with space bar being jump   and the mouse buttons allow the player to turn the character   however  the player can also hit the left ctrl key to launch a   39 fireball  39   which melts the   39 ice  39  blocks   using tha left alt key  they can plant an ice block  or use c to throw one   while experimenting with their capabilities  the players are reminded by the temperature meter that energy is conserved

aVi was coding pretty much all night  i made 3 things but i think this was the one i liked the most  i had made an astronaut game where the background would change as the player got further into space killing aliens  then  i realized i could do something else with that code  so  i decided to go ahead and make a puzzle game in which the pattern to change randomly was applied to villains  so here the player would have to think of his next move and try to be at the same spot as the bad guy while collecting  5 hearts  the game would get harder as the grid you were in got bigger each level and more villains came out  i had used weird music because i wanted the game to have a dark feel  however  i still was not happy with this  so  i decided to combine the elements that i like  music and visuals  and decided to make an audio visualizer  i made a website for my clothing company and tried to use sentigrid and ziggeo to upload videos of my eyeparty but i simply ran out of time  moreover  i tried to incorporate the leap motion but it seemed to be incompatible with my computer  i was very ambitious in my first hack

aVwe noticed that the geaux hack schedule involved a nerf gun fight  since we already wanted to build a hardware based project  we decided to build a nerf turret that was controlled via the internet   our target users are anyone interested in playing with a nerf gun over the internet  and our targets are the victims that we will shoot with the toy   the two big key features of our project is the hardware implementation and the integration with that hardware over the internet   the gun mount was built with limited tools and supplies  but it still turned out better than expected   the internet interface was a challenge  which involves sending commands directly from the internet down to the hardware level

aVpybroadcast functions as an email sms gateway  adding a wide range of functionality to sendgrid that it previously lacked  pybroadcast allows bulk email and sms broadcasting at the same time through a small  easy to use script  sendgrid  39 s api allows both to be sent simultaneously to the python server  which parses the messages and follows commands   39 sendemail  39  or   39 sendsms  39  found in the messages from sendgrid  on the reverse  sms can be sent in to the python server and transformed into emails  then broadcast back out  this allows seamless communication while roaming even if there  39 s no wifi or data around the inspiration behind this came because my phone carrier  republic wireless  does not support email sms and so i cannot send myself messages from my computer to my phone  this project allows me to bypass that deficit and communicate with my phone  both forwards and backwards while away  my current phone plan also does not support any roaming data  so every communication to my device needs to be across sms if i  39 m not on wifi  pybroadcast will  in the future  allow me to function as if i did have data by packaging up files on the server  sending them across sms to my phone  and recompiling them   140 bytes per sms message  to display appropriately my favorite part of the project was the most frustrating and  in the end  the most rewarding  python has built in libraries for parsing rmtp messages  which look something like  but the parser fails whenever there are reply chains being parsed  i had to build my own parser using regular expressions  regex  which was quite the experience  but in the end a simple two lines of code grabbed exactly what was needed from the mess i believe the project has multiple real world applications  without modification  pybroadcast can be used as an emergency sms and email broadcast system simultaneously  if something happened on campus and necessitated immediate broadcast of 30 000 sms and email messages  pybroadcast could handle it all within half an hour from one script  or many times less with parallel scripts running in third world countries  there is nigh ubiquitous cell coverage yet virtually no data  pybroadcast bypasses this problem and allows data to be sent via sms along with easy email functionality from the phone

p3913
aS''
aVafter a long and discouraging series of failed  quot dream projects quot   our team finally decided to go for something purely fun rather than technologically innovative  what are the odds  was born as a game played amongst our group of friends  and this application allows one to bring it into the digital format  in what are the odds   any number of players may enter the game upon initialization  after which players take turns proposing  quot challenges quot   a regular  quot challenge quot  involves simply making a task that could be fulfilled by a single person while a  quot special challenge quot  is one which involves having a single person perform a task to or with another player  after a challenge type selection is made  the appropriate number of players are randomly selected  at this point the primary challenged  the person who must perform the given task  will a pick a number denoting what the odds are that he she would like to take against this task  approved of by the group  against one  e g  if the task were to to be eating five burritos in five minutes  i may make the odds 1 to 15   once the number against one is given  the challenged is to pick a number in the given range  if the computer picks the same number  the challenged must then go through with the challenge  if it does not  the challenged goes off scot free  we see that the challenged indeed has  theoretically  one in x odds for selected x since he she must perform the challenge in x x 2   1 x of the outcomes of the game  after this  the players are given the option to play another round or exit  we hope that  through this application  we can spread the fun of what are the odds to people everywhere

aVbussadda

aS''
aVbussadda is an idea that can change the way people look at public transportation system these days  with the ever increasing traffic  life on roads without public transportation is a thing far beyond imagination  however  just like any other domain  public transportation too faces grievous concerns that need to be addressed as soon as possible  the design team surveyed 500 people around pune to talk  about their opinions on the current bus transportation service  and the following conclusions were extrapolated  1 75  of the population asserted that they had been late to their destination because they decided to wait for a bus instead of walking   2  96  of the population affirmed that knowing the position of the buses on campus would be                 beneficial in deciding whether to walk or wait for the bus  3  96  of the population also affirmed that knowing the location of the buses is more indicative of wait time than an approximate arrival time  4  the overall approval rate of the current transportation notification service was 38   if passengers had an easy way to see which bus is near to their location and approximate time it would take to reach the stop  in real time  they could make a more accurate  informed decision of whether or not to wait at a stop  the real time bus monitoring and passenger information system will provide pedestrians with this convenience  not only would the real time bus monitoring and passenger information system be a new product for best transportation  it would also be an improvement to the transportation service already provided  addressing the dissatisfaction with current wait times of the buses

to comeconfigurable  about 100 ways already cool transitions and effectspower of d3 exposed in the form of d3 selections in the resultant uvcharts objectuvcharts quick start guidethis guide is to help you begin using uvcharts to build charts on the web  uvcharts uses d3 js and svg html5 to build charts henceforth ie8 and below aren  39 t supported adding the library to your paged3 js being the only dependency for uvcharts  has to be included along with your other scripts before harnessing the power of uvcharts on your webpages  d3 js is available on cdn henceforth you can directly include it using the following code in your webpage download the latest version of uvcharts  either minified or unminified  fromhttp   www github com imaginea uvcharts distand include it too in your webpage using the librarykeeping simplicity as our first priority  we  39 ve ensured that we build a single function api which adheres to all your charting requirements var chartobject   uv chart charttype  graphdefinition  optionalconfiguration  lets get started with a simple example  lets say we want to plot no of users using a certain product for the past 5 years  we need to now represent this data in some form which uvcharts understands graph definitionwhich uvcharts understands is a simple json object with 2 key value pairs       categories          dataset             since we want to just plot data corresponding to one product  say   39 uvcharts  39  itself  the categories array consists of 1 element       categories     39 uvcharts  39        dataset             but we haven  39 t provided the data corresponding to this category yet and that is where the dataset part comes in  lets set some data for uvcharts so we can plot it var graphdef         categories      39 uvcharts  39        dataset               39 uvcharts  39                    name     39 2009  39   value   32                  name     39 2010  39   value   60                  name     39 2011  39   value   97

dom element using the uvcharts library  all you need to do is call the uv chart function from within the javascript runtime in your page var chart   uv chart   39 bar  39   graphdef  that  39 s it  your chart is ready  the chart is by default placed in a dom element with id   39 uv div  39  and this can be overridden  more on it later  here is the interesting part  no matter which chart you want to represent your data in  the graph definition doesn  39 t change  so if you want to represent the data in the form of a line chart var chart   uv chart   39 line  39   graphdef  more var chart   uv chart   39 area  39   graphdef   var chart   uv chart   39 stackedbar  39   graphdef  the same applies for all 12 chart types that we currently support now you  39 re wondering where do you get to customize the chart in the 100 ways we claim you can  well  the uv chart function takes in a 3rd optional parameter configurationwhich overrides the default configuration thus letting you build your own unique charts if you  39 ve noticed the chart created above  it doesn  39 t have captions and axis labels  thus looks like a dumb representation of some random data  lets go ahead and add them right away var chart   uv chart    39 bar  39   graphdef        meta             caption     39 usage over years  39           subcaption     39 among imaginea os products  39           hlabel     39

         notice that the graphdef has 4 categories in the categories array but data for 5 categories in the dataset  the series corresponding to wavemaker isn  39 t rendered as it is not part of thecategoriesarray  thecategoriesarray not only defines which series are drawn in the chart  but also the order in which the series are drawn lets plot this multiseries bar chart on our webpage var chart   uv chart    39 bar  39   graphdef        meta             caption     39 usage over years  39           subcaption     39 among imaginea os products  39           hlabel     39 years  39           vlabel     39 number of users  39           vsublabel     39 in thousands  39          the graph definition defines whether the chart is multiseries or single series based on the no of elements in the categories array and thus has a uniform representation throughout we hope the tutorial was helpful enough to get you to begin using uvcharts to be implementeduvcharts interface to configure and modify the chart in real time  under development uvdatauvdata is a javascript based data manipulation library which acts on a ist of json object  a list of tuples   it is still work in progress and can be used to do complex operations on data together with uvcharts  it will provide enough options to play around with data and visualize it in whichever way you want to see it contributorskiran

aVi wrote mindscope mainly for myself   i was envisioning an app which would be a mix between mind mapping like scapple and focused  quot drilling down quot  into sub boards like workflowy you can add text entries to a board  move them around with your finger  aligning them  setting font sizes  etc  the  quot killer feature quot  is then being able to tap any of the entries and a whole new sub space opens up where you can add additional entries this simple system enables a perfect mix of quick thought capture and hierarchical organization  the simplicity of text makes something like kanban or a simple brainstorm totally easy to do  but being able to move entries into their own categories also makes a gtd system really doable here  39 s what one of my first users had to say  quot i love outliners as that  39 s how my brain works but they  39 re only somewhat visual  every item has the same appearance even though two items may have the same parent child relationship but have a dramatic difference in importance to me  this creates noise that  39 s not easy to filter out unless i curate what  39 s in the outline  but i need to collect all types of information regardless of importance   the differences in context importance creates a need for a way to visually   39 draw  39  out thoughts on a canvas without losing the hierarchy and ability to drill down into sub levels  you  39 ve done this   brilliantly  quot

aVbackstorythe year is 20xx and the nsa and anonymous are entrenched in war over digital privacy  in a moment of clarity the nsa decides to combat anonymous  39  hacker ways by going old school and storing all their image data offline    so they reroute the images captured by their drones from a central server that would be easy to hack for elite hackers like anonymous  to    shirts of course  you can  39 t hack a shirt just kidding real description   ideationi was honestly looking for a unique way to capture a moment  these moments would be commemorated on attire  cases and mugs obviously  but what moments could i capture  i then  thought about how drones are changing the way we take pictures   film movies  and it occurred to me that those moments could be retrieved off of a livestream and put on a tshirt  and with such goshirtspro was born as an avid snowboarder i have quite a few moments i captured with wearable that i would commemorate  i took a bunch of pictures at mountain peaks with my family that i could easily put on a mug for everyone to remember that christmas by tech   stepslivestream is being broadcast to the web page from the goprowebserver which i access via proxy from a localhost node express serverwhenever i wish i can take a picture of the current moment  generally 3 4 seconds ahead of the livestream i can then select the garment  size and enter payment shipping info and submit the image to our server  note this does require the client machine you are using to have network connections one local for the gopro and one external for the shirtsio api wrapper after submitting i get a quote with which i can then submit my order  once i submit the rest is handled by shirtsio scalablepressi did not submit a website like because my demo has to be done locally in order to pair with the go pro the demo i  39 ve created is done using a go pro  but really it could be done using any livestream given the right api

aVthis app came as a reaction to the fact that thalmic labs had not come out with their android sdk yet  although that was the case  this did not stop me from making an android app to interface with myo  i thought that if you could have a web app read the gestures and send that to the device real time  you could allow myo to indirectly control the device and that is exactly what i did i used a combination of firebase and android to create an app that lets you control your android device with your gestures  you can either mute it  maximize volume or minimize it  i plan on adding more features soon  my target user is anyone with a mobile phone

aVwhen exploring myo  we were immediately drawn to this unique tech  39 s potential to aid others who are hard of hearing by creating an app that allows people to communicate through signs translated to text we often take the simple act of conversation for granted  forgetting about those who communicate differently  however  in reality  17  of americans  36 mil people  are deaf adults  we wanted to be the heroes and create a messaging app that can bridge the gap between the deaf and the hearingthe myo was a little difficult to translate into intricate sign langugage because can  39 t detect specific finger movement  instead decided to do bigger motions which allowed us to create a pseudoasl made specifically for myo  39 s capabilities  while this app just works with a few signs for now  shows the enormous potential in what the future of communication will look like

aVecosystems are complex by their very nature   the importance of the right balance between numerous components is often hard to understand  builders want more buildings  homeowners want to be close to the water  crabbers want more crab   yet  we clearly can  39 t have more of everything  people often don  39 t understand the relationship among the components of the ecosystem and the delicate balance needed to keep things functioning both developers have a long history building rich visual and interactive simulations  and we were motivated by a hackathon  quot consultant quot  from mde who suggested building a bay simulation  we were inspired by the popular games of simcity and minecraft as they both show how the richness of the simulation and interactivy is more important than visual realism to convey complexity the goal of this project is to help students understand the complexity of the chesapeake bay ecosystem  and the nature of the relationships among components  we anticipate that baysim would work well as a kiosk in an information center  or as an enabling technology in the classroom for middle or high school students we think the interactive and visual nature of the simulation makes it unusally engaging and understandable   we proud that we were able to create a fully functional multi platform  windows  mac  amp  linux  prototype during the hackathon by building on one of the developer  39 s previous educational simulation environment   the code is open source and available on github  it is clearly structured and has parameters that will make it easy for other developers to modify it to create their versions of the simulation and adapt as they see fit   we also used a very flexible model for the bay itself by providing the data in the form of a simple text file with elevations so the simulation could be readily adapted to other regions some technical background 1  we first had to find a  raster based  dataset that describes the elevations in both land and sea  and then combined and calibrated the separate sea and land dataset  we were surprised that this kind of dataset did not exist  by defining our simulated region by just elevation data  the simulation can work without change to the code simply by changing the data file 2  the  quot simcity quot  style code that runs the simulation was adapted from a umd class that one of the developers  bederson  developed last year to teach python to non computer science majors  http   www cs umd edu  bederson classes paths f13     that simulation was much simpler and had randomly generated terrain and no sense of pollution  crabs  etc  but the basic simulation mechanism existed which let us focus on adding the details of the bay ecology to the simulation such as the previously mentioned elevation lab  buildings  pollution run off  crabs  etc   in addition  by controlling the river input and evaporation rates  the impact on water level can be investigated  thus showing the impact of changing sea levels 3  the current prototype is written in python which enables it to run as a downloadable app on windows  macs or linux laptops and desktops  however  we envision that baysim could be rewritten for the web using standard web technologies  without plugins  so that it could run on any device  including phones and tablets simply by loading a web page  this would enable new modes of collaboration and competition across devices that we think could make baysim even more exciting

aVflacq is about exploring how technology can bring us back outside to engage in fun games with others  an actual social game that encourages face to face interaction with other humans  gasp   the rules are simple     as long as a player is within range of a flag they contribute towards claiming that flag for their team     the more players at a flag  the faster that team will claim it    players from opposing teams will cancel each other out    once the flag has been claimed  the team will score points as long as it is in their position    the round ends when one team reaches the decided upon point total  such as 100 by using ibeacon technology  our game allows players to use estimotes as their flags  this ability frees players to create games on a small or large scale   in the city  in the woods   anywhere they have a cellular signal so that gameplay data can be synched live across devices

aVwe wanted to reduce the friction involved when crowdfunding  especially for charitable causes and small fundraisers  so  we created token to create a new campaign  fundraisers mention our handle  quot  sendtoken quot  with a brief summary and link to their cause  when an interested donor sees a tweet for a cause she  39 s passionate about  all she has to do is retweet to send a  1 microdonation for that cause  donations are automatically processed between the donor and fundraiser via their linked venmo accounts  first time fundrasisers and donors are messaged with a link to sign up for token with their twitter and venmo credentials the end result is a seamless single click experience for donors and fundraisers  by using the retweet as our donation mechanism  we leverage twitter user  39 s trained behaviors and we capitalize on the inherent virality of the twitter platform

aVbuilt at yc hack 2014  sonic locator is an ios app that lets you understand navigation information through audio cues fashioned after sonar pings   the app is targeted at navigation in non urban environments  where a destination may be known but it is difficult to maintain a straight path towards it   for example  in the ocean  wind  currents and lack of landmarks interfere with your ability to travel in a line  while in the wilderness  flora and geographic features rarely allow you to travel on the shortest path   regular audio cues enable you to continue moving and adjusting to the conditions without being interrupted to constantly check maps and take bearings there are three modes through which you can specify where you want to go bearing  i e  compass heading    input your desired heading  from 0 to 360 degrees gps map  pictured    center the map and chose your desired destination mark input  i e  saved waypoint    when you are at a point you want to get back to  you can save it with the  quot mark quot  command   then later on you can get a vector back to the point the app is constantly tracking your current gps position and compass heading while in use   once you have chosen one of the three  quot destinations quot  above  the app will calculate the path from your current position to your desired position in the form of a heading vector   combined with your current heading  the app generates an a series of audio pings directed at you from the direction of your destination   this allows you to keep a spatial reference to where you need to go regardless of obstructions that may cause you to go off your path technologies used ios  objective c corelocationopenal via objectalin addition to outdoor navigation and orienteering on land or sea  sonic locator may have good potential to teams venturing in unfamiliar areas  such as search and rescue or military applications   directional audio to augment reality is something that hasn  39 t been explored a lot in regards to collaboration   if a group of people can have an auditory cue of the locations of their teammates  they can work together more effectively finally  an extension of this technology combined with microlocation could be used as an assistive technology to the disabled don  39 t forget to put your headphones in the right way

aVwhy i want caddyever since i dragged around my suitcase all weekend when i went home to new york  i have wanted an on demand concierge service to take things from me when i don  39 t want them and bring them back to me when i need them   people shouldn  39 t plan their lives around things   bags  bikes  groceries  furniture   but around what they want to do   caddy let  39 s people do that by instantly offloading anything they don  39 t need right now so they can continue on doing what they wanted to do in the first place how it workssign up and schedule a pickup   a driver will come to your location  collect your items  and that  39 s it you continue on with your day the way you want to when you need your items again schedule a delivery wherever you happen to be and your items will be promptly dropped off   if you aren  39 t going to be around simply simply give your confirmation code to someone who will and they can complete the delivery for you key featuresscheduling pickup delivery  the user ordering the caddy has their location automatically detected but can set a new one if their location is off   the driver  me for now  is notified that a pickup is required  pickups up the stuff and then marks it as complete sending time estima updates  the user is updated as to how far away their caddy is via text viewing orders   a user can view all past and present orders  and schedule delivery for them as appropriate a different kind of logisticsonce uber raised their most recent round  everyone wondered how a taxi company could possibly worth so much   their answer  we  39 re not a cab company  we  39 re a logistics company   route planning is a very hard problem  and uber sees themselves as uniquely positioned to leverage their network for greater goals   i eventually see caddy being the same thing  except that there is a subte distinction in the types of problems each would solve   uber only needs to get something from point a   gt  b   caddy  39 s logistics looks something like this pickup item from a        some amount of waiting is involved profit  while also giving the customer back their items it  39 s more akin to solving both the uber problem  pickup and delivery  while also dealing with the amazon problem at the same time  hold onto item for x amount of time then deliver    i sadly haven  39 t solved these problems in the last 24 hours  but the world is a messy place and i believe that this sort of asynchronous delivery schedule is something that could be a huge boon to the world

aVwe want to define a small network that runs parallel with facebook and it can extract some pieces of information that you expect to find on facebook  in our view  facebook now is really complex and users need more valuable information at this time  you all nearly cannot search any phrases inside facebook  on our system  we use facebook platform and facebook developers to extract many status  pictures and links from facebook and show them to our users in a efficient and more suitable way  everyone can search something they want on facebook through our system  that makes sense some keys feature that we really proud of is that our user can do any basic actions like what they do on facebook  they can like  share  read and write comment to any fanpages on facebook we also define a new feature called  quot link quot   that makes user link to their friend and information they expect to save for furthur use  each user can create a mini library of fanpage that they link  so when they log in to our system  it doesn  39 t take much time to view new posts around many fanpage

aVi think that cashflow is a basic business concept that a lot of new small business owners don  39 t understand or realize the importance of until it  39 s too late i specifically wanted to address basic cashflow management for small businesses with less than  500 000 in receipts annually  my target user is a small business owner who has an expertise  for example  a chef  and is branching out to open their own business after years of working for someone else  i want to provide them an easy educational tool for understanding how cashflow works  i specifically didn  39 t want to become a new accounting package or a new crm software or reinvent any other wheel the process to use the application is to create a business with an initial bank balance and then submit regular expenses and then see the impact of those expenses  the graph view shows from today through the next 30 days  your estimated bank balance and runway from today are always displayed  the editing transaction features allows the small business owner to easily experiment with how changes in disbursements and receipts impact their cashflow  i specifically stayed away from accounting language like   39 debits  39  and   39 credits  39  and instead used easy to understand language like  quot money going out quot  the feature i am most proud of is the recurring payment schedules  this feature prevents a lot of tedious data entry

aVhaving worked at farmers markets for several years now  i realized that each day we were selling our products  customers would often come up to us with specific requests  unfortunately  many times we would not be able to fulfill these requests  simply because of a lack of product though most farmers carry a large variety of products  they can only bring a few of these to the marketplace  there is always a sense of uncertainty  in choosing which products to bring along  and which to leave behind with agrago  farmers can connect with customers to take the uncertainty out of selling

aVnational storm shelter gps precise map points
p7608

aVa news story on cnbc and npr explained the innovation of an app that can pull one county database of shelter locations with no reported gps  hundreds of counties in america require shelter location reports and none of them offer an app to help families report the exact gps coordinates   i thought about how easy it would be to give citizens an ability to register their precise shelter location along with basic shelter information with a standard mobile device gps sensor and app   the data obtained will be sent  to any county registered shelter database so that after a tornado devastation  first responders can search for trapped families in a timely and effective manner  this app could easily compliment fire fighters apps pulling the precise data points and because we are utilizing a national dod adopted xml standard schema for registering points of interest on maps   other developers could gain proper authorization and utilize this data for other critical national mapping use cases    we want to build a national citizen enterprise mapping point standard  not just a storm shelter precise reporting app  but that is a great start and valuable asset for our tornado prone states   future development activities centered around this challenge post could eventually integrate reports to the centralized national database on dangerous down or damaged power line reports  dangerous intersections and homeland security threats across any platform and application  we want to build the standard and create simple apps citizens can use to report critical mapping points for first responders and assist our national security  the people offer the greatest benefit to saving lives when disaster strikes  i can build this open system for state county and national systems to use  and this simple  innovative app to help citizens report their precise storm shelter locations will help save lives

aVwhat inspired us when one thinks about salesforce  most of the time what come to mind is a crm app that helps track my users from lead phase to client phase and everything in between and there after  but salesforce as a platform has great power that could help any firm organization for not just  capitalizing on the outside clients but also the inside clients  employees   all the employees who could and should use salesforce are inside clients and thus one need to try to convert them to regular salesforce users to get more out of the platform  this salesforce platform adoption for these users  if tracked in correct way  could help us derive  efficient strategies and great campaigns to make salesforce a fun platform for everybody problem statement track the use of the salesforce1 app among your employees  when a firm is investing so much effort and money in salesforce  how much of it is actually gets used by your sales people  whats the roi for this investment in salesforce for the firm  many times sales people are supposed to use the salesforce app on the road but are not able to do it because of various reasons and habits  this results in poor quality data as we tend to forget the things in other daily activities and more important  i am serious      things  also ignoring this salesforce users login details related statistics is missed opportunity to make salesforce a better platform for everyday needs  what kind of browsers users are using the most to login on salesforce   how many logins are from mobile devices   how ofter user logs in   how long they stay active   these are some of the great kpis that could help derive efficient strategies and correct campaigns to make the salesforce platform service a fun place to be and benefit both the sales people and their management our solution projectuno will help tracking the salesforce users login sessions and derive some kpi with great graphical presentation to highlight users usage pattern like when do they login most  heatmap showing where are the most active users on the map  how many of them are online now using the mobile app  how often they stay on mobile sessions  which browsers are most common for login  what demographic regions are the busiest in the salesforce usage  what user types are logging how often  what percentage of the population is mobile only user versus desktop users  mac vs windows user etc  this will help you device campaigns and strategy for faster adoption and use of salesforce platform across the firm and industries  the need could be different for different but the same data could provide the required analysis for designing the correct and efficient strategies and campaigns  also thought in the framework is making salesforce platform a fun place to be by gamification of the adoption path like automatically enrolling the users to raffle or giving them chance to earn bitcoins points for correct improving behavior and use of platform where this fitstarget users management who wants to track the salesforce platform adoption in the firm  one who build strategies and campaigns for salesforce users adoption increase  managers who want to track their subordinates salesforce usage patters for various reason  performance measurement   to track how efficient the sales people are using the platform  cfo and team   to calculate roi for a huge platform like salesforce every one else   to get inspired to make the salesforce a fun place to be key features we are proud of heatmap showing the geographic details about the user mass of salesforce ability to tap in the geo location  of users when they login to understand how are user spread geologically  gamification of strategies and campaign to make salesforce a fun thing to use  kpi derived from the login details which are easily available in the salesforce platform

tested to work on mac osx 10 8  to download our project and run the code locally  follow the following procedure dependenciesvirtualenvwe usevirtualenvto help facilitate getting setup on a new machine  there area number of ways of installing it  depending on your operating system gfortrangfortranis required to install scipy  if you  39 re running mac osx  we recommend usinghomebrewto install gfortran brew install gfortranmongodb  database backup  and environment variables  optional for just running recommendation engine the data on dota 2 matches we collected was stored in a mongodb database  to extract the data to train new models  you must firstinstall mongodb  then download the backup of our databaseandrestore it using this tutorial also  our data collection script   dotabot2  data collection dotabot2 py   uses a few environment variables for configuration so that these sensitive variables are not stored in the public repository  therefore  you must initialize the following environment variables export dotabot api key  steam web api key  export dotabot username  email username  export dotabot password  email password  export dotabot hostname  email outgoing smtp server  export dotabot db server  mongodb server  export dotabot db name  mongodb database name you may find it helpful to add these commands to your bash profile in your home directory so they are automatically executed each time you open a new terminal window clone the repositorygit clone git github com kevincon dotaml gitinitialize virtualenvfrom inside the repository root folder  initialize virtualenv by running virtualenv venvthis creates a new folder in the directory called  quot venv  quot  you only need to do this once  don  39 t worry about ever accidentally adding this folder to the repository  there  39 s an entry for it in the  gitignore file next  activate the virtualenv by running source venv bin activateyou should now see  quot  venv  quot  as part of your terminal prompt  indicating you are now inside your virtualenv  note that closing the terminal window deactivates virtualenv  so you must runsource venv bin activateeach time you open a new terminal window for

all  the unfortunate reality for most of us  html inspector is opinionated  but every rule is completely customizable  so you can take what you like and change what you don  39 t  it  39 s also easy to extend  allowing teams to write their own rules to enforce their chosen conventions for a more formal introduction  please refer tothis blog postwhich goes into more detail as to why html inspector

categories  validation  best practices  and convention each rule is registered via a unique string identifier that can be used to include or exclude it at inspection time here is the full list of built in rules by their identifiers   validation rules validate elements validate element location validate attributes duplicate ids unique elements    best practices inline event handlers script placement unused classes unnecessary elements    convention bem conventionsthe following is a more in depth explanation of each rule validationhtml inspector is different than a markup validator  validators parse static markup  while html inspector runs on a live dom  this makes it a lot more powerful  but there are some drawbacks as well  because html inspector runs after the browser has parsed your html  any mistakes the browser has forgiven will not be seen by html inspector as a result html inspector should not be seen as a replacement for validation  it  39 s simply another tool in the toolbox  that being said  there is still a lot that it can do  and does  to validate your markup here are the validation rules that ship with html inspector   expect this list to get more comprehensive in the future  validate elements  inspect each element in the dom and reports any elements that are invalid or obsolete  this will catch simple things like misspelled tags  instead of ` lt li gt `   and it will inform you of deprecated tags  like  `  and more recently`   any element you don  39 t want to be warned about can be whitelisted validate element location  make sure that elements don  39 t appear as children of parents they  39 re not allowed to descend from  an example of this is a block element likeappearing as the child of an inline elements like `` validate attributes  like validating elements  this rule will let you know if you  39 re using attributes that don  39 t belong on a particular element or perhaps don  39 t belong on any element  if your project uses custom attributes  likeng  in angularjs  they can be whitelisted duplicate ids  warn if non unique ids are found on the same page unique elements  warn if elements that should be unique  likeand  appear more than once in the document best practicessome markup may be perfectly valid but use practices that are commonly considered to be poor or outdated  the following rules check for these types of things   note that everything in this list is subjective and optional  inline event handlers  warn if inline event handlers  likeonclick  quot return false quot are found in the document  inline event handlers are hard to manage  hard to debug  and completely non reusable script placement  warn if script elements appear anywhere other than right before the closingtag  because javascript is blocking  addingelements anywhere other than the end of the document may delay the loading of the page  if a script must appear somewhere other than the end of the document  it can be whitelisted unused classes  sometimes you  39 ll remove a css rule from your stylesheet but forget to remove the class from the html  the  quot unused classes quot  rule compares all the class selectors in the css to the classes in the html and reports any that aren  39 t being used classes that are in the html as javascript hooks can be ignored via a whitelist  by default  any class prefixed withjs  language   orsupports is whitelisted  more information on the rationale behind this rule can be foundhere unnecessary elements  anytime you have a plain amp lt div amp gt or amp lt span amp gt element in the html with no class  id or any other attribute  it  39 s probably unnecessary or a mark of poor design elements with no semantic meaning should only be used for presentation  if the element has no attributes but is used for styling  it must be done through a rule like some class  amp gt  div    which is just asking for trouble  again  more information can be foundhere conventionthe real power of html inspector lies in its ability to enforce your team  39 s chosen conventions  if you  39 ve decided that all groups of links should be contained in a amp lt nav amp gt element  or all amp lt section amp gt elements must contain a heading  you can write those rules  and an error will be thrown when someone breaks them because convention is usually specific to individual teams  there  39 s only one built in rule in this category  but hopefully it  39 ll get you thinking about rules your team could use bem  the increasingly popularbem block  element  modifier  methodology is a css naming convention that is very helpful for large projects  the problem is that using it correctly in the css is only half the battle  if it  39 s not used correctly in the html it doesn  39 t work either this rule throws an error when an element class name is used but that element isn  39 t a descendant of a block by the same name  it also errors when a modifier is used on a block or element without the unmodified class there too  note  there are a few different bem naming conventions out there  html inspector support thethree most common writing your own rulesrules are the bread and butter of html inspector  they are where you check for problems and report errors here  39 s how you add new rules htmlinspector rules add name   config   func name   string  thenameparameter is a string used to identify the rule  it must be unique configoptional object  theconfigparameter stores configuration data that is used by the rule  anything that users of your rule might want to customize themselves should be set in theconfigobject func   function  thefuncparameter is an initialization function that is invoked as soon as you callhtmlinspector inspect    the function is passed three argumentslistener reporter  andconfig  thelistenerobject is used to subscribe to events that are triggered as html inspector is traversing the dom  when problems are found  they can be reported to thereporterobject  theconfigobject is the sameconfigthat was passed tohtmlinspector rules add  though its properties may have been customized by other users between then and now eventsthelistenerobject can subscribe to events via theonmethod  like with many other event binding libraries ontakes two parameters  the event name  and a callback function listener on event  callback event   string  the name of the event  see below for a complete list of events callback   function  a function to be invoked when the event occurs  the function will be passed certain arguments depending on the event type  see the event list below for argument details here is a an example of binding a function to the  quot class quot  event listener on  quot class quot   function

rule that would warn users when they  39 re using the old convention htmlinspector rules add     quot deprecated data prefixes quot           deprecated    quot foo quot    quot bar quot

aVevery year approximately 3 5 million students graduate with some type of college degree in the u s  alone   many of them attend lengthy graduation ceremonies with thousands of their peers   at the university of california  davis  for example  we annually graduate between 5 and 10 thousand students across 12 colleges and professional schools  most ceremonies are held in our largest indoor stadium  all of these ceremonies are streamed live and later on demand by the campus  39  media services group  even when physically present  but certainly when watching the live or on demand video it is easy to miss those you care most about for several years we have been thinking about how to efficiently provide parents  family  and friends  with a reliable way to find the exact moment when the person they care about is announced by name  crosses the stage  and receives their diploma   in the case of uc davis  and potentially many other schools  the solution lies in printed name cards carried by every student  these cards are read by professional  quot readers quot   often containing added phonetic information to help with pronunciation our design involves the use of a unique qr code for each student  printed on the back of their name card   the qr code will be scanned just before the student  39 s name is announced   the exact time code and identify of the student are transmitted to a central server where they are later synced up with the on demand video of the ceremony we plan to use kaltura to stream our on demand ceremony video in multiple flavors   the rich player with its javascript api allows us to provide users on any web based platform with the ability to view the commencements in their entirety  by featured speeches  or at the most personal level of just the brief time when their family member is on center stage for the competition  we also integrated the technology of voicebase to obtain transcripts of the ceremony   those portions of the transcript that apply to keynote speakers are separately identified and linked to the appropriate presentation   we have found these transcripts of full length speeches to be quite good even in their machine generated form   however  a long series of diverse and unique names  as one finds during the diploma award process  presents a more challenging situation for any automated system   our application clearly demonstrates the synergy that can be realized by combining an automated transcription system with a qr code based encoding finally  we are grateful for the participation of rackspace in this competition  last minute vpn issues arising between hotels and our university servers prompted us to try out rackspace  39 s cloud servers  with relative ease  a server was instantiated and configured  our final submission url below is the result all back end server software for the competition was written in python  combining the kaltura and voicebase apis with a sqlalchemy and the postgresql database  the client is based on the kaltura player toolkit and jquery  we used opencv and zbar to generate and scan the qr codes

aVi was inspired by the message of this hackathon  the idea that anyone who is interested can learn about computers was a big drive behind this  importantly  i wanted to help people understand the insides of things as well as the outside  it  39 s all vey well to see a nice looking gui or python wrapper for something  but there is nothing compared to the excitement of understanding what  39 s going on behind it  the layers of software libraries  socket communication  and  ultimately  the one dimensional world of memory and processing at the bottom and who understands this better than hackers  after all  most of what they do is finding things that people forgot about what  39 s underneath   a lack of sql input sanitization  a program that runs as the wrong user  an executable that  39 s just a little bit bigger than it really needs to be  hackers understand  more than anyone else  just how much of a machine a computer is with this in mind  i set out to make a game that would teach people to think this way  to understand the underneath  i chose c   as my language and sfml as a media library  since i already had some experience with them unfortunately  24 hours is not nearly enough time to create a fully ledged prototype  with those restrictions  as it stands  i have made what might be considered programming concept art  the data structures behind it are extensible and modular enough to make it into something bigger with more time  but right now it doesn  39 t do much but display a snapshot of a game in progress

aVat first we were going to try making an app but then we went to the codeup workshop where they taught us about html and cheyenne came up with the idea of building a webpage where people can go to find the rules of the games many people commonly play  one of the things we are proud of on our page are the links that will take you to a specific game so you don  39 t have to scroll all the way down   the target user for our page would probably be younger kids trying to show quickly learn a game they heard of

aVso with just 10 days left in the competition i came across the delivery com challengepost hackathon  i thought this was a really cool idea and wanted to see what features i could add to enhance the user experience  so i recruited my partner and we got started  so please keep in mind liquory is a result of just 10 days of hacking but we  39 re more than pleased with the results liquory is also the result of several hours of thinking about how the make the alcohol purchasing experience easy  fun  and enjoyable for the consumer  we  39 ve come up with some great features that really enhance the consumer  39 s experience first off we integrated with delivery com with almost full user capabilities such login signup  add remove address  add cc  view order history  seeing which orders you  39 ve favorited  search merchants  purchasing items from merchants  adding those items to a merchant cart  on checkout we aggregate all carts so users just go to one place to checkout carts  even if they bought from several merchants   ability to view individual carts and them  plus a host more because of the little time we had in this competition  we chose not to implement guest carts or use guest tokens  we wanted to implement the majority of delivery com  39 s functions and you need to be authenticated to do that then we brought other great integrations  our bread and butter   we integrated with yelp com and their api to get relevant merchant data such as merchant images  star reviews  and descriptions along with that we pulled from google image search and created a script to retrieve item images which were not present in the delivery com api  this allows us to really enhance the consumer  39 s experience we really wanted to make it easy for the average person to find whatever alcohol they  39 re looking for so we developed our own search algorithm to search by keyword  i e  quot coors light quot  and location so that the user gets back a list of the item they were looking for in their search location and because sometimes users don  39 t know what to search for  we implement a search by image function  where the user can simply take a picture with their camera phone or upload one via the web app and in a matter of second get relevant item results for their searched location we also integrated with the beer social network untappd to allow users of that platform to add different drinks to their untappd wishlist  the user must authorize their untappd account with the liquory app and finally we integrated with yummly com to provide for the consumer with a fun new drink recipe each day they can go make  this allows users to get new ideas and then go buy the right alcohol though liquory in order to make the drinks

aVhow do you drive users to online delivery today  online deliveries are a cost effective and hassle free alternative to going out  no waiting  effective and secure payment  and a lot of laziness  but it  39 s hard to create a steady source of growth in users for a menu aggregator website  because at the core of it  an online delivery is a solo affair  no one brags about their recent online delivery from dominoes  therefore  users do not discover restaurants around them  as they aren  39 t bothered looking at search results they were already not interested in   so how does one make online deliveries a more user centric rather than utitlity centric affair  we can assume that a regular user would try out a new restaurant that was recommended by his friends family  seeing someone you know using an app is the most significant factor for trying the app out a user desires a fast and simple platform to create and order a menu  with a user interface which helps  and doesn  39 t hinder him  the process should be effortless users often do not know what food they want  they might want to try new food  but do not know what to order  they won  39 t be bothered with checking out reviews for each restaurant in their ordering radius simple is designed with this in mind  its a web application that looks great on mobile and even better on a computer this is the homepage you simply type your address in and it shows menus created by users around you  this data is stored on a cdn  content delivery network  which makes it super fast and simple to use there are some dummy menus created at the address fourth street  san francisco  searching for it yields results below in a fashion similar to the facebook newsfeed  albeit with a couple of cool css tricks  the address is geocoded almost instantly and adaptive  so although the orders were made at fourth street  if a user has an address of fifth street  close enough locations will show up as well to order  you can just click on any of the menus and click on the order button  any menu you like  created by people living around you  this page updates with new orders in real time  it looks cool  each menu has it  39 s own page  this menu makes it easy to see the menu made and share the menu  each menu has a distinct url  address   this means you simply copy the url of any menu and can share it with people you know  also  the site attempts to have a clean and minimalist look  thus  it does not load any social plugins or widgets  any sharing is done at the sole discretion of the user  this is in recognition of three things something like an online delivery will benefit greatly from direct person to person sharing  like a brother to his sister  not taken seriously by someone who sees a tweet by an acquaintance about an awesome menu he created  a college kid sharing it with his room mate or friends is much more effective  as it also ensures geographical proximity to a certain degree to improve website speed  social widgets take user data  so they add to load times of the website the menu publishing is anonymous  which caters to people not wanting to create accounts  just order food  and not worry about people judging their diets  integration with delivery com accounts is coming soon you can also simply create your own order  the page to create your own menu is fast and looks good  the page is broken up into a window with the search results for your location  behind it is a google map of all the places around you marked  it adds a modern look without taking screen real estate to appreciate the application  you need to try it out yourself  go to the website and click on  quot make your own menu quot   and search for a location which is supported by delivery com apis  you will see that the map is created simultaneously while the merchants are loaded  this adds to an extremely different experience which creates an illusion for a lesser load time  try it out  and you  39 ll see what i mean ultimately  i attempted to create an application that is fun to use and easy to share  it  39 s simple elements inspired the name  quot simple quot   and am proud of the web design  as well as heavy lifting done by the application behind the scenes  trending menus and each menu looks great on a mobile device and phones with the latest browsers can see animations as well notes  i am still completing the ordering process but as the cart is already stored it is not too hard  also  making your own order is unsupported from phones  because it is something a user can do directly from the delivery com app or mobile web instead

aVthis app simulates the effects of gravity  you can fling particles at each other and watch them interact  create solar systems and galaxies  make a planet and fling asteroids into it  add a black hole and watch everything get sucked in  you can even adjust the size  mass  and color of the particles  zoom in and out and look around with two fingers during physics class this year  i wanted to explore the effects of gravity further after we learned about newton  39 s equations in class   it began as a personal project  only intended for my experiments  but i soon realized the project had potential   i polished the app  added features to easily adjust the properties of planets  and created a starry sky particle effect to use as a backdrop   my favorite feature of the app is the ability to create black holes   i based the black hole physics on real physics  but i had to adjust the speed of light in my calculations so that the user  39 s initial black hole would be of a visible size   the user can create a black hole by setting the mass very high and the radius very low   the black hole looks different from other particles   they are pitch black  but i gave them a glowing white edge to make them visible against the black background   they will absorb other planets upon collision and will grow in mass and radius accordingly   the two hardest parts of the app were managing collisions with black holes  and optimizing the gravitational function to increase performance   the app is meant to be used by anyone from elementary school kids to working adults  and i have worked to make it user friendly so anyone can figure out its basic functions   the app has over 4000 downloads  and counting  from all over the world

aVmy application is the first step towards a sign language learning software using the unity engine and the leap motion  what my app does is take in finger data from the leap motion and uses that data to convey to the user in text  what number he she is signing  for now  the app only recognizes the numbers one through ten  in the future  i hope to use the leap motion to build a whole library of signs so that people can be able to easily communicate via sign language to others locally or globally

aVthe paradox that nearly all families come to know  the exhilarated student driver ready to tackle the world with their recently acquired driver  39 s license  versus the loving  yet fearful parents who have to watch them set out on their own  parents will always want to know where their kids are at  as well as whether they have made it to and from their destination safely  in today  39 s world  the easiest and quickest for a student driver to communicate their location is with the use of text messaging  however  parents worry that their children may engage in texting while driving  in addition  parents want their children to develop a sense of responsibility  exhibited by their ability to return home by a set time the curfew buddy provides a much needed solution to both of these issues  while the curfew buddy will send reminders to the student driver  as to when to be home  it goes much further than a simple curfew reminder app  the curfew buddy allows parents to know where their child is at when traveling to and from destinations  however  the curfew buddy stands out from traditional  quot kid tracker quot  apps  in the sense that this app is designed to help teen drivers and their parents  simultaneously unlike other  quot kid tracker quot  apps  the curfew buddy doesn  39 t simply provide parents with the gps coordinates of their teens  rather  it automatically alerts parents when their teen has arrived or left predetermined locations  the automatically generated notifications reduce the chance of teen drivers texting  while driving  this way  the teen is not being  quot tracked quot   yet parents can have ease of mind because they will know that their teen has arrived safely at his or her destination

p8943
aS''
aVi have found most districts do not have school apps  which to me is really surprising considering the emphasis placed on technology in those schools  i think that if all schools had access to an open source template for a school app  not only would it fill a void in the app store  but the template would act also as a project that motivates students and teachers to learn to code with a material end result  so while one may not necessarily find ground breaking algorithms in this app  i think an end goal of making it open source will provide a mechanism for all school districts to take part in this technological revolution i  39 m most proud of the intuitive user interface  i found that while i was fairly easily able to write the actual code for the app  designing a ui that was intuitive was a huge challenge  i also think an intuitive ui is one of the most important aspects of any app  while a program may contain the most efficient algorithms ever developed  without a good ui nobody would want to use it

aVguava is a windows phone app that tracks user  39 s athletic activities and posts them onto the social network  strava  the app also allows users to see what their friends are up to  search for popular places to ride in their area  and use many other tools that use the strava network  guava is basically a mobile app that gives windows phone users a way to access strava  39 s key features for some background information  strava is an activity based social network that is already popular on ios and android  it is mainly used for cycling  but is popular with runners too  what makes strava unique is that users can designate a section of their activity as a  quot segment quot   which creates a leaderboard  this leaderboard serves as a virtual race  in which users compete for the kom  king of the mountain   segments can be made from anything  ranging from a 100 mile road loop to a 10 second section of a technical trail descent   when users upload an activity to strava  it automatically scans the ride for segments and ranks the user accordingly  currently  there is no official strava app on windows phone when strava released version 3 of their api  i saw an opportunity to give windows phone users a way to use strava on their phone  my goal was to make an application that would provide the basic functions of the official strava app  these being ride recording  reviewing your own ride  and an activity feed in which you could see your friends  39  rides  guava does all of these and more guava  39 s recording function is simple  but user friendly  to record  the user just has to tap the record button  and go out on their ride  one thing that i worked hard on was getting the recording to continue while the app runs in the background  this means the user can look at a map  listen to music  or lock their phone  and the app will still record  when the user finishes the ride  they can just go back to the app  press the finish button  title their ride  and upload  all uploads are automatically saved to the phone for backup in case the upload fails  so the user can go into the  quot saved quot  menu and upload again   development wise  the recording is simple too  while the activity is being tracked  the gps runs an event each time a new location is recieved  this location is stored as coordinates with a timestamp in the phone  39 s memory  when the user uploads the ride  the app formats this data into a gpx file and sends it to strava  strava then processes the file and looks for segments  etc guava also integrates the social network aspect of strava  using the activity feed  profile page  and friends list  the user can look at their own and their friend  39 s activities  due to limitations of the api  the app does not incorporate commenting or  quot kudo ing quot   but if they are ever added to the api i plan to add them to guava  it also cannot look at a friend  39 s activitiy directly from their profile due to api limitations  however they can be accessed through the activity feed my favorite part of the app is the explore page  it was also the trickiest to make  basically  the user is presented with a map  and they can zoom into a certain area  from there they hit  quot load segments quot  to see the most popular segments in the area  along with the leaderboards for those segments  this is cool because users can now find new places to ride no matter where they are   when i was developing this  i was having troubles on where to place the list of popular segments  as it was always cramped  accidentally  i placed the list over the map  however  with a transparent background  it gave a layered look to the app  and was a great use of space  i decided to just disable the map scrolling when the list was up  and i think it works well the app is listed for free in the marketplace  and currently has nearly 1 700 downloads  i  39 ve met some very helpful people who have worked with me to work out some bugs  and though there is still some minor things to fix  the app as a whole is working well  making guava was a huge learning experience for me  as i learned about the formatting of gpx files  how to use strava  39 s json based api  and loads of user interface skills  as well as how to create a reliable windows phone app in general  which uses c  and xaml  which both have many potential uses for future projects  thank you for considering my submission

aVwater bottle rocket simulation

aVwe had carefully researched every aspect that affected the height to which the rocket would fly  and yet after all of that research  we had no precise way to optimize the performance of the rocket  we had no idea how high it would go  or if we needed to slightly alter wing shape  we had no clue if should add more water or take away water to properly balance the rocket  in fact  we had no idea how the rocket would even fly   if only we could alter the precise rocket design on a computer instead of real life  so began our quest to build the perfect water bottle simulator so we began our investigation of the aerodynamics and fluid dynamics behind the motion of our rocket  one that turned out to be an elaborate challenge  our intention was to provide physics students  like us  the ability to learn about the different factors that affect flight  the flight path of the rocket depends mainly on three factors  the weight of the rocket  the thrust provided by the water  and the drag caused by the surrounding air  however  the weight of the rocket largely depends on the amount of water in the rocket  so everything became very complex  as the rocket expelled water to generate thrust  it also lost weight  increasing the impact of the thrust  to account for which we needed to implement complex calculus equations  in addition  to calculate the rate at which water leaves the rocket  we had to implement several fluid mechanics equations to implement these complex equations we had to brush up on our math and physics skills to thoroughly understand the forces behind the launch and flight of the rocket  we found many formulas briefly mentioned in our physics textbook  but also found that these calculations required the understanding of several calculus concepts  some of the formulas were so general that we had to derive our own equations such as the change in mass as the rocket is launched  our textbook said to simply take the integral of the mass with respect to time  however  it gave no formula for rockets  by overcoming these obstacles  we developed a deeper understanding of the underlying physical principles behind the motion of the rocket we also faced many setbacks in regards to glitches with the animation  our animation would lag and would be misplaced on the screen  the moving objects in our original animation would appear to jump across the screen  because of this  we started to use javafx which automatically buffered our animations  this made our rocket animations much cleaner and smoother  previously for animations we used the generic java library called swing but after incorporating javafx  we found that javafx used a different notation in its code  in order to complete this project  we learned new notation to properly incorporate animations after creating this simulation  we developed a deeper understanding of the underlying physical principles behind the motion of the rocket

aVi coded this game as my first semester final for my introduction to computer programming class  i wanted to create a game in which enemies are searching for the player and he she must avoid being seen  i decided to implement a time limit  which doubles as the player  39 s score  if it reaches 0  the game is over  the player can collect points  small yellow squares  to increase the amount of time they have left  as well as their score  movement is controlled by the arrow keys  if the stealth square is moving too slowly  change the key repeat delay in system settings  gt  keyboard   the blue shapes represent walls  and they will push the player back if he she collides with it  whenever a collision occurs  the wall checks if the player is above to the left  to the right  or underneath  and then pushes the player in the opposite direction  the large yellow squares in front of the red circles represent the enemy  39 s line of sight  if the player is caught in the line of sight of an enemy  the screen will fade and the player will be placed at the beginning of the level  the larger  border less yellow squares are the keys  and the transparent gray rectangles are the doors  once all of the doors in a level have been opened  they turn white after corresponding key is collected  the exit will began to changing colors to attract the players attention

aVthe scale of the universe
p9038
aS''
aVin seventh grade  my science teacher showed us a video similar to the famous quot powers of ten quot    i was so fascinated by the idea of comparing vast differences of size that i decided to make my own interactive version   similar applets already existed on the internet  but none of them covered the full range of sizes or used a continuous  easy to use zooming mechanism i wanted to employ   thus  over the next four day weekend  my brother and i developed the first few drafts of the scale of the universe we spent the next few years improving and perfecting our application and adding new features   although i really enjoy our intuitive slider bar  i am most proud of the translations into 18 different languages   thanks to online volunteers  the scale of the universe can easily be viewed by people from around the world our goals are to inspire wonder in our natural world and teach the true meaning of size measurements   all people should be aware of their place relative to the universe   we are giants compared to the subatomic realm but mere specks of dust from a galactic perspective  hopefully  the scale of the universe can clearly demonstrate this wide range of sizes and open our eyes to the vast array of worlds that cannot be easily seen

aVnemo productivity tool

aS''
aVabout nemonemo is a productivity tool designed for ease of use  it was designed to address the following issues poor attention span lack of focusdifficulty managing timebeing easily distractedas a high school student  i often find myself confronted  with homework  projects  and exams  all too often the compulsion is to delay the important work in favor of something more immediately pleasing  or perhaps to do the work only to become distracted shortly after starting  all too often i  39 ve heard the following from my peers about procrastination  quot i should study  but i don  39 t feel like it right now  quot nemo hopes to help remedy that issue why nemo i  39 ve got a friend who goes by the nickname  quot nemo  quot  he exemplifies the problem i hope to help fix  although he  39 s a very capable student and an avid learner  he  39 s often sidetracked by the internet and his surroundings  this application is inspired by my friend   but is intended to be easy to use for anyone how it worksnemo borrows from the  quot pomodoro technique  quot  a means of managing time which consists of dividing work into small intervals  themselves separated by short breaks  aside from being a web interface for the pomodoro technique  nemo also allows the user to modify the length of work periods and break relaxation periods  as every person works differently  ultimately  nemo provides a clean and painless way of practicing effective time management interacting with nemothe most prominent part of the application is the timer in the center which counts from 0 minutes and 0 seconds up to a maximum of 60 minutes the user can modify the duration of the work period  with a default value of 25 minutes   as well as the duration of the relaxation period  with a default value of 5 minutes   when time is up for either period  the timer turns red and a sound plays  removing the need for the user to pay any attention to the application while working  work periods and relaxation periods follow one another  and the timer resets  automatically   so you never need to intervene  in fact  it only takes one button to start the cycle   quot start  quot  at the bottom  the button transforms into a  quot stop quot  button in case you ever need to stop the timer  a label in the center denotes whether you should currently be working or relaxing

aVreading classics at home
p9053
aS''
aVwe came up with reading classics at home after our english teacher informed us that we would no longer be reading a book because the school had lost or damaged too many copies  we realized that a solution to this would be to take advantage of electronic books so that schools could save money and still teach important classical texts to their students as avid readers  our goal extends further than just providing a practical solution for our school  we believe that literacy plays a major role in development and education  and this shouldn  39 t just be limited to a classroom setting  enter  quot reading classics at home quot   a website that provides anyone  not just students  with the opportunity to study classic english literature for free we have two functional previews available on the website for  quot a tale of two cities quot  by charles dickens and  quot emma quot  by jane austen  the website is mobile compatible  so you can access it anytime  anywhere besides that  we take pride in creating a website that  39 s functional and easy to use  our classmates call our site  quot sexy quot   and maybe that  39 s all it takes to get people reading

aS''
aVhurdle jump is an app inspired by my passion for track  specifically hurdles  i wanted to make a game that was reflective of my personality and incorporated aspects of games that i enjoy  hurdle jump  39 s layout is simple  but the player quickly comes to realize the difficulty in succeeding and obtaining a high score  players control two runners simultaneously during their sprint over hurdles  if you touch the right side of the screen the top runner jumps  if you touch the left side of the screen the bottom runner jumps  your goal is the jump over as many oncoming hurdles as possible  the game ends when a hurdler fails to clear the obstacle   during development  it was important to make the app challenging enough  so that players have the drive to increase their high score  game center leaderboard and twitter are currently the two options embedded in the app for players to boast to their friends about top scores and drive competition  creating hurdle jump for the house app challenge has acted as a  quot jumping quot  off point for my development of future apps

aVcome code with codester: an educational app that teaches computer science
p10198
aS''
aVeducating young students in computer science remains a challenge despite the rapid progress of cs technologies over the past decades   thus  i developed codester  a novel  original android application  that teaches novice users the principles of cs  users learn sequencing  code reuse  decision making  iteration  and efficiency  unlike other cs education tools  codester appeals to young users because it requires little reading or prior coding knowledge  it promotes rapid self guided learning through a game structure  and it utilizes the accessible  mobile medium   during multiple user test studies of grades 1 8  students showed rapid improvement in all coding concepts that codester teaches  a majority of students reflected that codester was more engaging than a different  web based program  since it was a challenging game rather than a script of commands  boys and girls alike engaged with codester and enjoyed working with the mobile platform  thus  this teaching tool is effective in teaching young users cs concepts

aVi have been developing and programming games and apps for the past 4 years  one of the most difficult issues i have faced while pursuing this hobby was trying to finish a game that i had already started  i had developed the tendency to start multiple new games as i came up with new and innovating ideas  and so all of my games were left unfinished  however  the recent flappy bird craze in mobile gaming inspired me  the game was extremely simple  yet its difficulty and controls made it addictive and irresistible to play  because of this  i began to create path finder  my goal in developing this game was to establish a simple yet never ending goal where the player inevitably failed  similar to flappy bird  i wanted to make my game playable to all ages yet still retain its appeal   in path finder  the player drags a finger across the screen vertically or uses the accelerometer to avoid the colored squares  as the game gets harder the longer you survive  you need quick adaptation and fast reflexes  creating this game taught me many things  for the first time  i learned to implement an online high scores leaderboard and an achievements board for players around the world to compete against each other  in addition  i used google  39 s admob services to create ads in my game  because i spent so much time adding these features  i am proud that i succeeded in not only finishing the game  but also adding to it with new versions

aVa+ grade calculator
p10478
aS''
aVthree years ago  i was introduced to the concept of code by my technology teacher  mr  pyatt  he inspired me to take my limited knowledge even further  and thus this app was born  the a  grade calculator helps both students and teachers calculate a percentage and grade simultaneously based off of a raw score and cross reference them with a variety of grading scales  this solves a huge problem i  and my peers deal with on a daily basis  how do you know what letter grade you earned  and even what percentage  when you have 7 different teachers using several different grading scales  and all they give you is fractional representation of your score  the main feature of the a  grade calculator that differentiates it from a normal calculator is its ability to give an actual letter grade based off of many different grading scales  no other app exists on the app store that can do this

aVthe allspark is a mashup of many api  39 s ultimately resulting in a powerful yet simple interface that allows the user to accomplish tasks such as email and tweet by simply making a phone call  users can listen to recent tweets read to them over the phone as well as post new tweets by placing a call  wikipedia and wolfram alpha also provide data and computational power  so users can simply call a number to solve complex math problems or research a topic  sms can also be used instead of a call our target user is one that does not always have access to internet or wants to reduce data consumption  since all our communications happens over a telephone line  no internet is required  users who do not have smartphones would especially benefit the feature we are most proud of is having allspark speak answers back to you as well as the accurate voice recognition when posting tweets

aVhellovr is a service that allows users to connect with one another in a virtual world like how skype  oovoo  facetime  etc allows others to contact each other via webcam phone camera  hellovr instead utilizes the oculus rift to give users a more vivid experience through virtual reality  we predict that virtual reality will become a very dominant platform in the near future for social networking  with so many use cases of virtual reality we hope what we developed brings us closer toward allowing others to communicate with each other as if they were there with them targeted users are essentially everybody  all age groups  giving all a social experience like none other the network code is the component of our code we are most proud of since we  39 ve never done any network programming before

aVwe  39 re all young childrenses  we use the computer to retrieve and send information so often  we wanted to use those exact same information retrievals to build our own web app  our app pulls data using google data v3 api in json format  and spits it out into something more awesome using d3 in our front end  we  39 re running flask and hosting in the heroku cloud  and hand coded our html  css  and javascript  most of it at least   our target users are anybody who wants to check out their followers  or check out their favorite channels  39  followers  most of the new software we used in the project was learned during the project  and the fact that we were able to complete the project was actually surprising  also includes fun feature filled tab based navigation  that doesn  39 t really go anywhere particular at all  regardless the whole experience has been both enriching for us and hopefully for everyone who enjoys our work

aVone of the downsides to popular events is the stressful ride home all too often when you go to a major event  you have to struggle through hours of traffic before the event starts and then have to battle through massive queues that occur when everybody leaves at the same time  this completely kills the vibe of the event and tarnishes the positive memory of the event forever auckland events gathers data about events in the auckland region and then hooks into the auckland transport api to get real time information about where buses and other transportation options are near events   reminding users of events that they are interested in  and allowing them to generate a transportation plan for low stress arrival and departure from events for those users who have absolutely have to drive  nearby parking spots will be found within walking distance to the event and metrics will be gathered to estimate what parking spots are more likely to be empty future features will allow users to create group plans and share them on facebook or twitter this app is completely cross platform and leverages the power of html5 to give you real time updates about where busses are in your area  the app will be built with a responsive design allowing for devices of all screen sizes to use  a minimalist flat design scheme will allow users to get straight to the information they want with no distractions

aVwe started by identifying the exciting part of the provided api   the real time bus tracker  knowing where the buses are is great but it needed a layer that will make it useful to users at a touch of a button  so the idea of alerts was born instead of having to go online  search for bus times  guesstimating when the bus will be at your stop and how long it will take you to walk there  we are creating a mobile app that tells you when you need to leave your location  gtfo   in time to catch the next bus the app will calculate walking time from your location to the nearest bus stop  using google directions api   at the same time as checking when your preferred bus  pre set in the app or chosen at time of use  will be there  based on its current location and approximate time it will take to reach your stop the app will then alert you when you need to start walking this is just a description of the base app which could be enhanced with features like custom multiple alerts  bus schedules and maps  bus stop selection  custom time allocations if the user lives in an apartment building and needs extra minutes to get to the road where google starts calculating from etc this is aimed at everyone that catches the bus but has a hard time of staying focused on what time they have to leave to make it in time

aVmost of my friends and colleagues own a car in auckland but the primary problem that they face is to park the car at some place which is near their destination place of interest  in order to do this they go to google and find what are all the available parking and find a particular location in order for them to park the car to save this overhead i have created this simple android application which would search for a parking space across the auckland area using the auckland transport api my target users are the the ones who have cars as their primary source of transportation my application does not have a lot of features and due to limitation of filter entities i could not complete the feature which i might be proud of which is the google maps  original idea for this feature was that user can click on a image and gets redirected to the google maps in the application and on click of any location in map it would return back the address and using this address i can give information of all the parking spaces available at a radius of around 1 km  i could not implement this idea so as of now the google maps is just putting a marker which gives the current location and the user can look up into the other feature onto where the parking space is located

api for query construction auto increment  indexing and many other sqlite features composite column indexing complex query construction  e g  distinct  min max  join  group by  etc  automatic data type conversion installationput  lt a href  quot https   github com ayltai android lib database jar android lib database 1 0 jar quot  gt android lib database 1 0 jar lt  a gt  to your project  39 slibsfolder quick startfirst we have to define a pojo class just like any other orm libraries  for example  we have a map application that contains tablescountryandcity define pojo classwe create 2 classes for table mapping  lt pre gt   table public class country        column autoincrement   true  nullable   false  primarykey   true      private int id  column nullable   false   index unique   true  private string name    column private string description      empty constructor for insert statements  public country           set id through the constructor for select statements  public country int id        this id   id        we define only the getter  not setter  for id because id is an auto increment column     we don  39 t set its value for insert rows  for select rows  we set it through the constructor  public int getid         return id        getters and setters for name and description       lt  pre gt likewise forcity  lt pre gt   table public class city        column autoincrement   true  nullable   false  primarykey   true      private int id  column nullable   false  private string name    lt  pre gt here    table  annotates a class is a pojo for table mapping by the library  by default the table name is the same as the class name  you can define custom table name countries  like this  lt pre gt   table  quot countries quot   public class country              lt  pre gt   column  annotates the field column mapping  incountryclass  we have definedcountry id country nameandcountry descriptioncolumns  there are 4 attributes supported by column value valueis the default attribute  when omitted  the mapped column name is the same as the field name  otherwise  it will use the specifiedvalueas the column name autoincrement  set totrueif it is an auto increment column  default isfalse nullable  set tofalseif the column cannot benull  default istrue primarykey  set totrueif it is the primary key column  default isfalse  indexannotates table indexing  it has 2 attributes value  the default attribute  when omitted  the mapped index name is the same as the field name  otherwise  it will use the specifiedvalueas the index name unique  set totrueif the indexed column is unique  default isfalse  compositeindexannotates multiple fields indexing value  defines the name of the index  all fields annotated with the same compositeindexname will be grouped to form a composite index order  defines the ordering of the column in the composite index   uniquecompositeindex   same as compositeindex  but this one is for unique composite indexing   useconverter  specifies non standard sqlite data type conversion  for example  ajava util datefield can be converted to alongbefore storing into the database and vice versa  this annotation specifies whichtypeconverterto use for this purpose  you can create your custom converter by implementingtypeconverterinterface  this library includes adateconverteras an example object mappingthis library includes a ready to use mapper rowmapper  for object mapping  we can extend this class like this  lt pre gt  public class countryrowmapper extends rowmapper              lt  pre gt typically we don  39 t call its methods directly because this library handles all of these things for us  we will show you how later bonus  json mappingthis library includes a json object mapper jsonrowmapper  to minimize the tedious work of writing wiring code  the only requirement is that the json object  39 s field name has a 1 to 1 mapping to your column name get a database connectionwhen using sqlite in android  typically we usesqliteopenhelperto get asqlitedatabaseinstance  this library includes adatabaseopenhelperthat does what asqliteopenhelperdoes  and handles any necessary table creation tasks  however  in most cases we will be using thedatabaseclass which does all these stuff for us we can get a database connection like this  lt pre gt  database database   database newinstance context  country class  city class    lt  pre gt the above line will open a sqlite database  or create one if it does not exist  if the database is new  it will also create the tables we specify countryandcity  define all the columns and create any indexes we annotated query constructionyou can build a simple  or complicated selectstatements like this  lt pre gt     select   from country where name     39 spain  39  order by name query query   query select   columns   from country class  where predicate equalto  quot name quot    quot spain quot    orderby  quot name quot   build   list countries   database execute query  new countryrowmapper      lt  pre gt for simple select by id statements  you can calldatabase selectbyid country class   quot id quot   1 without using thequeryobject for insert statements  you can simply calldatabase insert acountry   alternatively  you can construct a customized insert object byquery insert  and calldatabase execute query to execute raw sql statements for delete by id statements  you can calldatabase deletebyid country class   quot id quot   1   or  similar to insert statements  you can construct a customized delete object byquery delete   predicatesthis library provides complex predicate construction  including   gt  likeis nullis not nullinbetweentransactioncalldatabase begintransaction  to declare the begining of a transaction  when you finish  calldatabase commit    or if it fails  calldatabase rollback  within thecatchclause transactions can be nested  just like a normal sqlite database you use in android typical use of transaction  lt pre gt  try       database begintransaction      perform insert delete etc that modifies the database       database commit     catch  sqlexception e        database rollback      finally       database close       lt  pre gt close the databasejust calldatabase close  to close your sqlite database  uncommitted transaction  if any  will be rolled back

aVlife gets busy  we should get recall alerts on products we use with zero extra effort in practice  no one place knows about all the products we use  we buy products from different retailers  both online and offline  most of us don  39 t have a habit of creating and updating a list of every product we own our email archives may be the single most comprehensive source of information on our shopping history  we tend to keep the same email address es  for many years  online stores automatically send receipts to our email inbox  offline stores have started to offer email receipts as an option too  our email conversations with friends may also reference products we own technology that can automatically review our email archives and alert us to recalls on products found in those archives would bring us closer to a world of zero effort recall alerts  this submission  code named  quot total recall 101  quot  is a working prototype that shows how current technology can positively impact the hundreds of millions of people who use email  according tocomscore  over 95  of americans with email access use one of three email services  yahoo  gmail  and hotmail  for demonstration purposes   quot total recall 101 quot  makes use of the u s  consumer product safety commission  39 srecalls api google apps scriptand gmail search to create a functional app that users can install in minutes using a web browser  the app generates alert emails that can then be read from any device  including mobile devices installation instructions accesstotal recall 101using your gmail account  all your email information remains private to you go tohttp   www google com script start and click  quot start scripting quot  to create a new blank project copy and paste the  quot total recall 101 quot  code into your new blank project  you may rename your blank project  e g  to  quot my total recall 101 quot   in your project  go to  quot run quot   gt   quot totalrecall quot  on the toolbar  provide the app script with authorization to run  the requested set of permissions allows the app to search your email archive with the latest recall information and send you alert emails that help you know about relevant recalls wait for the script to finish running and then check your gmail inbox  you should have received a total recall email you can set the script to run every day or every week using  quot resources quot   gt   quot current project  39 s triggers quot  on the toolbar  the script saves information on the date of the last run  and will only show recalls issued since this last run date

aVintroductionthe node go2js is a thin node js layer on top of go2js native parser to generate an mozilla ast tree with loc parameter that matches the line in the original golang code  it is currently a server side solution leveraging the native binaries to produce line to line matching to the generated js code motivationgolang is my choice because of its recent trend of popularity and the power of concurrency  it is a challenging problem because golang is a compiled language with some functional interface implementationgo2js managed to match go and js code exactly line by line  so it could output a js ast tree with loc information to be parsed by aether for the games  it is also able to output some basic syntax errors if the code does not work  i am reusing go2js  39 s binary parser so it is significantly faster than solutions from generated parsers such as peg js wrap   and parse   endpoints are supported for aether integration  for more details  please checkouthttps   www npmjs org package node go2jslanguage supportit is leveraging most of the core golang features mentioned here http   godoc org github com kless go2jsnot yet implemented  range with index  startof  endof  the multiple assignment has different order of preference than in js  functioninverse in  quot testdata func go quot  fails due this issue   evaluation of constants  shadow variables in js  goroutines  types int64 and complex rangessince we have the line number matchup  it is possible to have loc information in the js ast tree matching the native golang code  since only the information for line is reliable  the column information is generally irrelevant to aether but the golang compiler error messages can be used directly to report errors on line column other worki have another potential sub submission here https   github com ttback erlang shen jsthat attempts to take erlang to javascript world  the motivation for supporting erlang is that it is the de facto standard of concurrency and  scalability on the web despite its arcanic syntax  in the end  yes  we can build erlang code and pasrse wrap them to readable js code  but erlang ast only understands line number by default  we  39 d need a lot of hack at the otp core in order to only get line column information out  indexed ofs will be another level of hack  i already contacted some core maintainers on otp and n2o group  creator of shen   they like the idea of code combat  there is a patch with range info coming up  hopefully erlang js will be a reality down the road

aVi was inspired by the concerted effort to develop so many source to source compilers for codecombat  it seemed like it would be a great step forward for the platform and that made me interested in contributing  unfortunately i joined the challenge pretty late and am only a beginner at writing compilers  so i decided to tackle a small  minimal language  i chose io as it was minimal  elegant  and not so obscure or impractical as to be considered esoteric the intended audience was the codecombat team  and by extension its users  however  while i believe that my parser can handlesomeof codecombat  39 s levels  it  39 s not yet ready for production use  it is still more of a hobby project in its current state a feature i am proud of is the approach i used to support infix operators of variable precedence  io  39 s operators are syntactic sugar for messages  much like ruby  39 s   and the set of operators  with associated precedence  can be extended at runtime  most parser generators aren  39 t built for this sort of thing  so i was stuck on it for a while  after giving the problem a lot of thought i ended up using a modified operator precedence parser to make a second pass over the syntax tree  transforming chains of messages into properly nested operators  tweaks can be made to support prefix  postfix  and right associative operators as well

aVpyparse is a parser for python hand written in javascript  this was heavily inspired by the parser library in the python built in library  it takes in python and outputs an ast for use in spidermonkey  etc  this will be available as a bower package  importantly  there are no dependencies for this project  i used grunt as a build tool and for minification the api to the parser is very simple  a call to parse   is made with the python code as an argument  the ast is output from there the parser has two main components  first  the call to parse sends the code to the tokenizer  the tokenizer is a finite state machine  moving character by character through the code  the tokenizer returns an array of tokens  the array of tokens is sent into maketreefromtokens  which recursively constructs the ast from the token stream thanks for taking a look

aVrestserverrestserver is a php library framework for building restful webservices and also websites it allows you to routemethod uriandmime typeto specific resources handlers  access the requested data and provide a proper response here it  39 s decribe its documentation  together with the example folder and tests for reference this version is based on thenamespaces branchofxavier usagethe simplest way is usingcomposer  just declare the restserver dependency in you composer json        quot require quot             quot restserver restserver quot    quot   quot         if not using composer  you can use therestserver phar  just download and require it in your application checkout theapi documentation the serverthe first step to defining you rest service is to instantiate the server  as follows  rest   new rest\u005cserverthis way the server will grab the requested uri to work with  or you can specify a uri if you are not working with urlrewrite for example  if the resource to load is coming from   get  quot q quot    rest   new rest\u005cserve   get   39 q  39    this way restserver will treat   get   39 q  39   as the requested uri creating resourcesthis is the main funcionality of this package  is to define the available resources  rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  url quot   quot action quot   dissecating this  you get a method  a uri and an action  any method is available  even custom ones  uris can be any uri and it support variable parameters  as follow  rest  amp gt addmap  quot post quot   quot  user  id quot   quot action quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  user  id posts quot   quot action quot   will give you a map to the  quot id quot  parameter  more on this later  on action  it can be a rest\u005ccontroller  a rest\u005cview  a method within any of these or a anonymous function  as such  rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot usercontroller quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot usercontroller  update quot     rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot  function  rest            return  rest         you can also map specific mime types to be accessible  according to the requested  quot accepts quot   rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot action quot  array  quot application json quot      rest  amp gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  uri quot   quot action2 quot  array  quot application xml quot    after setting the resources  you must execute the server echo  rest  amp gt execute   this will trigger the server to work more on resources handling on future topics global utilitiesthe server have a few utilities to deal with the global server scope you can set variables to be acessible at any rest resource as follow  rest  amp gt setparameter  quot key quot   value    key    rest  amp gt getparamter  quot key quot   you can also get all setted parameters with  params    rest  amp gt getparameters   you can set global accepted mime types  rest  amp gt setaccept array  quot application json quot   quot text html quot    you can dinamically set get the requested uri  rest  amp gt setquery  quot  uri quot     rest  amp gt getquery     rest  amp gt getbaseurl   the usage is very simple  first you  39 ll need to include either the  quot phar quot  or the initial rest server php class  lt  php include   39 restserver phar  39   api   new rest\u005cserver       more logic to come here   api  gt execute      amp gt you can instantiate the rest\u005cserver to start handling the requests  it will get the uri from the http request  but you can also provide a custom one for the rest\u005cserver  url  constructor after configuring the server you call the  quot execute quot  method so it can chain the request response cicle mappingmost of work is mapping uris to functions or controllers you can map any method  even custom  and uri to a lambda closure function or to a controller class  that implements rest\u005ccontroller  or a specific method of a controller  lt  php  api  gt addmap  quot get quot   quot  some resource quot  function  api           api  amp gt addmap  quot post quot

get quot   quot  foo   bar quot   quot mycontroller  mymethod quot  array  quot text html quot       amp gt the uri parameter accepts any regex  and also name parameters   name or   name for optional parameter   and an array of accepted mime types controllers and views also apply to lambda closure all controllers to be mapped must implement rest\u005ccontroller  it implies in implementing a single default method as follow and a public constructor with no arguments or optional arguments   lt  php class mycontroller implements rest\u005ccontroller           public function execute  rest                      gt other method that might get mapped into the server must also receive this one parameter this method parameter is an instance of the rest\u005cserver from where you can get the request details  data and response the methods can return the rest server  to end the cycle  or another controller or view to follow the request to  lt  php class mycontroller implements rest\u005ccontroller

by emitting events  that  39 s a very unique function of this module  link that with an ui and it will look flash  seeprogressevent below supportif you  39 ve found avconv useful and would like to contribute to its continued development  amp  support  please feel free to send a donation of any size   it would be greatly appreciated installationto install avconv  usenpm   npm install avconvthen

module  if you need help with parameters  have a look athttp   libav org avconv htmlsame goes with node streams  you can do anything with them you want  pipe them or listen to events  easy but if your  39 re smart  then go  have a look at the unit tests  they contain some nice examples using streams  amp  pipesvar params           39  i  39     39 pipe 0  39      tell avconv to expect an input

because data is utf8 encoded      console log data               stream on   39 progress  39   function progress               progress is a floating number between 0     1 that keeps you     informed about the current avconv conversion process              stream on   39 meta  39   function meta               meta is a json  here is an example           meta                 video

  39 data  39   function data               when you tell avconv to output to   39 pipe 1  39       this is where the data will end up  as a buffer                 you can also pipe the output stream pipe fs createwritestream   39 video mp4  39      stream once   39 exit  39   function exitcode  signal               here you knows the avconv process is finished           an exit code of 0  zero  means there was no problem  an exit code of 127 means the program avconv could not be found  i recommend you to use a switch block to deal with various exit codes depending on the log level you have passed onto the avconv process  the output might contain any useful information  beware that warnings or errors from within the avconv process are still shown as normal output in thedataevent whereas errors from the stream are rarely filled  errorevent   they happen only when there was an unix related problem about spawning processes  memory blabbah    apistream   avconv params avconv spawns a new avconv process with any given parameters  it does not validate the parameters nor mess with the results  that  39 s all up to you  you would see avconv complaining about bad parameters in thedataevent anyway  so one argumentparams   any array list with string arguments as values  see examples one return valuestream   a readable stream where you can attach well known events like  on   39 message  39   function data          a chunk of data with useful information  depending on the log level  any warnings or errors from avconv are there too  on   39 progress  39   function progress          a floating number  0 means conversion progress is at 0   1 is 100  and means  it  39 s done  very useful if you want to show the conversion progress on an user interface  on   39 meta  39   function meta          returns video meta data in json  on   39 data  39   function data          a buffer object with converted data  if outputting to pipe 1  on   39 error  39   function data          rarely used  would contain issues related to the os itself  once   39 exit  39   function exitcode  signal          for the exit code any integer where 0 means ok  anything above 0 indicates a problem  exit code   the signal tells how the process ended  i e  can be a sigterm you killed it withstream kill    if it  39 s null  then it ended normally and of course  you can kill  the stream  if you want to abort in the middle  it will kill the process in cold blood and delegate anexitevent to avconv  39 s internals changelogsee history mdcontributorsmichael heubergerjelle de loeckeryou licensemit

aV victorlourng com  victorlourng com a website for my digital self for the digital era  it really reflects who i am and my colorful personality    this is the third time i have redesigned my website in nearly a year  known issues can be found in this repo  39 sgithub issues what  39 s new just about everything a sidebar following design trends everywhere it  39 s not just flat  it  39 s dynamic flat pop culture  everywhere   easter eggs     spoiler alert  an even lower bandwidth footprint  placing the site under 500kb  with the heavy use of css3 and lack of images in fact  the only image used on my site is a vector avatar  i used icon fonts for everything else hosted on github pages and protected with cloudflare instead of hosting off a raspberry pi this results in up to 95  faster load times for people as far as europe jade and sass replacing php and less a css3 framework built from the ground up by myself instead of bootstrap seriously  though removed the backend and switched to google forms because there really isn  39 t a point for one standardsthis should pretty much explain everything if you  39 re using a slightly outdated version internet explorer  a derped speedster will prompt you to upgrade for face the consequences of a derped site on a derped browser that won  39 t be getting security updates anytime soon    dynamic flat designit  39 s  quot bold with a sense

 nothing more to say here javascript performanceas i quickly discovered  jquery  39 s  window  scrollmethod took up more than half of the rendering time  seen in yellow   it  39 s very inefficient and causes severe lagging whenever a user tries to scroll i was better off setting upscroll timeoutthat only calls  window  scrollonly immediately after the user has finished scrolling  the site will not feel as responsive for those who tend to keep their finger on the mousepad  but it  39 s a tradeoff i had to make  as a result  my site renders on average about 60 85 frames per second i have also made iframes not load until it is visible in the viewport  saving the user lots of unnecessary bandwidth backend  one of the limitations with hosting on github is that it doesn  39 t support php and because of that there really isn  39 t a backend  but i have found creative ways to working around that   the backend will be remotely run with openshift    eventually   oh wait  github pages

p14168

aVwearables like pebble should serve pertinent information when you need it  then melt into the background when you don  39 t   the more time a user spends fiddling with buttons and waiting for screens to load  the less advantage there is over just pulling out a more powerful and capable smartphone this is why i was a little disappointed when i discovered the apps on my pebble are so slow  they need multiple button presses to get what i want  and have long loading screens while they poll the phone for information  why can  39 t they be fast and smart enough to give me information right when i need it this is my solution   i integrated a watch face  a weather app  and a bus tracker into a single pebble app   all three apps intelligently share and cache information  so loading times get drastically slashed   and since you can access all features in a single click   everything you need is literally only a glance away   this is the future of wearables

aVcolorpattern is an augmented reality application that can be used by colorblind individuals to better understand the world around them  the key difference between colorpattern and other  existing augmented reality colorblindness solutions is that colorpattern is the first such app that is lossless  what this means is that the user only gains information  losing nothing  for example  the prevailing method of showing colorblind individuals that a color is one which they cannot recognize is to hue shift that color to another color  so green might become pink   while this works great on paper  in practice  it means that any objects that are the same hue as the color shifted too loose their meaning  if you have a pink ball and a green ball  and make the green ball pink  you still don  39 t know the difference between the two the end goal would be to have this app and or its methodologies embedded within wearable tech such as google glass  which is not yet powerful enough to support the computation needed for this project

aVonce you take notes with focusnotes you  39 ll never go back  when you sit in a lecture what options do you currently have to take notes  you can write with a pencil pen  but if you  39 re in a really rigorous class  chances are you  39 re going to write way too slow to keep up  you probably won  39 t understand the professor at all until you review the material later on your own  you could type on a laptop but then you  39 re frequently taking your attention off of the professor the type on your screen  you  39 re neck is going up and down constantly  and if there  39 s ever a diagram or equation written on the board  you  39 re speed goes out the window  you could not take notes and focus on the professor  but good luck remembering any of it 3 hours later that  39 s why we made focusnotes  focusnotes allows you to focus on a speaker at the same time as focusing on your notes by creating a simple yet powerful bulleted note taking text editor on glass  you can follow along with the professor wherever they may walk in the room and have your notes right infront of you  just use your own laptop keyboard to type and use our cool ui  plug glass into your laptop so it never runs out of juice  simple  just save it and we push the file  completely converted to a beautifully formatted bulleted word document  to your skydrive  as if you  39 d taken notes on a laptop  plus some extras thanks to mashery  but honestly  all the utility aside  the ui is the best part  you can  39 t just make a normal text editor on glass  it  39 s a totally different experience and you don  39 t have the space for it  that  39 s why we  39 ve made some cool improvements  we bring a bulleted experience without indenting  and always keep the subtopic you are currently typing about on the top of the screen so that you don  39 t loose where you are and don  39 t forget  for the neck strained students out there that are tired of looking down at a book and then back up again at a laptop for hours  focusnotes is perfect  not to mention you never have to spend the time finding your spot on the page we  39 re students who wanted this for ourselves to use  and we made it  we hope you enjoy it

aVever wanted to man a space shuttle to the international space station and have the controls literally in your hands  thanks to the power of the unity game engine and the leap motion controller  you will now have that opportunity your hands will guide the space shuttle as it tries to navigate its way to the iss  but the key word is  try   too many errant moves and you  39 ll find yourself crashing to the ground due to a lack of fuel  navigate successfully and you  39 ll be looking out at the stars    from space we utilized the mechanics of the unity engine to create a realistic feel to the game  using self created assets and open source assets from nasa and other sources  with the ease of unity  we were able to establish a prototype with in game physics far more easily than hard coding the project itself after extensive testing with the leap motion controller and the accompanying sdk  we modified an existing movement interface to create one that we feel the player can interact easily with and enjoy while they can attempt different movement tricks with the shuttle itself we believe the player can find much entertainment even if they don  39 t wish to achieve the goal of making it to the iss  by playing with the leap motion interface  the player can attempt outlandish stunts with the shuttle  such as attempting barrel rolls as it rockets into the troposphere the goal is to navigate to the iss by using the controller to steady the shuttle as it takes off  but arrive there before you exhaust your fuel reserves the team wanted to undertake this idea for a myriad of reasons  the original goal was to establish a form of a solar system simulation for educational purposes  at the same time  we wanted to design a program that would utilize the abilities of both unity and the leap motion controller to make the sim not only challenging  but fun as well when we went with the plan to create one small leap   we wanted to establish three phases to fully encapsulate the feeling of space travel and act as a tool for astronomy education  phase one is the prototype that you are currently viewing but with the added physics of booster thrust  atmospheric turbulence and wind effects to enhance the challenge of completing the goal  phase two was to implement the challenge of docking at the iss at a specific point in order to test the player  39 s accuracy  phase three was going to be a sandbox mode with the solar system in orbit  including the moon s  of the planets  and allow the player to navigate freely across the cosmos  as a player approached a lunar body  there would be statistical information about it displayed  such as circumference  time to orbit about the sun  composition and other relevant information that the budding astronomer may wish to study as a team  we had a great time attempting to create one small leap   a lot of time went into investigating how to further enhance our skills as unity and leap motion developers  which made for an excellent experience

aVoculus rift based first-person flappy bird with assisted learning algorithms and a light show!
p18708
aS''
aVmotion tracking through a pseye camera is processed for flapping motions while the user wears an oculus showing a first person flappy bird view   the flapping command is sent to an arduino which ensures a servo taps the smartphone that plays the game   another pseye camera captures and processes the phone screen to decode the game   this is sent to another machine over zeromq which creates a 3d projection and sends video to the oculus   another copy of the data is also sent to a different machine where a learning algorithm uses local optimizations to make decisions about jumping and sends commands to the hue accordingly   the user is also photographed and emailed a picture of themselves flapping for the game

aVthis app reads and displays nutrition information that has been encoded as a qr code  the app is completely offline and is able to read the information in the code with no reliance on the internet or an external database   this dependence is a major weakness of current nutrition tracking apps  which most often require the user to manually search through a large  but still incomplete  database   it allows the user to quickly and easily visualize nutrition information  this information accumulates over the course of the day  allowing the user to see when he or she is approaching his or her daily limits of each nutrient  these limits can also be customized  preferably with the help of a health care professional  to meet the user  39 s specific nutritional needs because qr codes are obviously not currently found on nutrition facts labels  this is more of a   quot proof of concept quot  app  designed to highlight the potential benefits of widely implementing a system in which qr codes are a part of the standard nutrition facts label  should this process become standardized  this app is intended to be released for free  giving access to the most possible users access and improving overall public health
